# Open Docs

Welcome to the Contrast Security Open Documentation Project. The published site can be found at [docs.contrastsecurity.com](http://docs.contrastsecurity.com). We encourage our community of users to contribute to our content library, as well as help us find mistakes and issues as they are encountered.

The project is part of the Contrast Openness Initiative which consists of an initial combination of our [Open API Architecture](https://api.contrastsecurity.com) and our [Open Documentation Library](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com). 

## Contributing to the Project
Contributions can come in many ways. End users can provide feedback of [issues](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/docs/issues) or submit their own [original requests](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/docs/pulls). We simply ask that you review the [guidelines for contribution](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/contribute_guidelines.html).

## What's in this Repository
The repository is intended to be the home for original markdown, images and other assets. The source code for generating this project is derived from the [Yeoman Web Scaffolding Project](http://yeoman.io) called [Assemble](http://assemble.io/).
