# Open Docs

Welcome to the Contrast Security Open Documentation project. The published site is located at [docs.contrastsecurity.com](http://docs.contrastsecurity.com). We encourage our community of users to contribute to our content library, and also let us know about mistakes and issues as you find them.

The project is part of the Contrast Openness Initiative, which consists of an initial combination of our [Open API Architecture](https://api.contrastsecurity.com) and our [Open Documentation Library](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com). 

## Contribute to the Project

Contributions can come in many ways. You can provide feedback on [issues](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/docs/issues) or submit your own [requests for updates](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/docs/pulls) to articles. We simply ask that you review the [guidelines for contribution](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/contribute.html#contribute) before you begin.

## What's in the Repository

The repository is the home for original markdown files, images and other assets. The source code for generating this project is derived from the [Yeoman Web Scaffolding Project](http://yeoman.io) called [Assemble](http://assemble.io/).
