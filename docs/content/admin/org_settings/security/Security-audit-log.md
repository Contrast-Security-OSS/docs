Contrast captures activity about all user sessions, including changes to settings or licenses and actions on vulnerablities. To see the log of the activity in your organization, go to the **User Menu > Organization Settings > Security tab**, and click the link at the top of the page to **View Audit Log**.

The grid shows the date of each activity and a message including the user's name and the action they took. Use the search and date control fields to find specific events within the log. 

Once you've found the information you need, use the **x** icon at the top of the page to exit the log and return to the main Security page.
