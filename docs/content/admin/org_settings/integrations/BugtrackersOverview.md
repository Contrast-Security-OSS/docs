Streamline the remediation process for vulnerabilities by sending details directly from Contrast to a configured bugtracker. Contrast supports integrations with the following services. 

* Mozilla Bugzilla
* Atlassian JIRA
* Visual Studio Team Services/Team Foundation Services (VSTS/TFS)
* Serena Business Manager

For more information about the configuration process for each bugtracker, use the quicklinks to go to the appropriate [articles](admin-orgintegrations.html).  

>**Note:** You must configure a bugtracker integration in your organization before sending vulnerabilities to it.
