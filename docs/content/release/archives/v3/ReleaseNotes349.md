## Improvements 

* Developers, rejoice! We've brought vulnerabilities directly into your integrated development environments (IDEs). If you use [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/contrast-eclipse), [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10335-contrast) or [VisualStudio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=contrast-security.contrast-vs-ext), download the [plugins](https://contrast-security-oss.github.io/) from the respective marketplaces and follow the installation instructions.

* Contrast can instrument and report on vulnerabilities in applications that use VMWare Xenon.

* The Contrast Security Java Service Broker has been updated to support Pivotal versions 1.11, 1.12 and 2.0.


## Agent Updates

### Java summary 

The Java team improved accuracy of Protect deserialization and agent startup time. We also fixed a bug that could prevent some agent information from reaching Contrast as well as a race condition that could cause an application to become unresponsive under certain conditions. And, yes - it's true: We added support for the Xenon framework. 

### .NET summary 

The .NET team improved performance of analysis of JSON-based deserialization, handling of proxy settings as well as Assess accuracy. We also fixed a crash bug when analyzing applications running on IIS Express. 

### Node.js summary 

The Node team implemented major improvements in accuracy and stability as well as increased performance in Protect mode. We also added the CSRF rule for Protect, and closed out issues interacting MongoDB and React. We now have initial support for React server-side rendering and the Hapi h202 authentication library.

### Ruby summary 

The Ruby agent updated the CSRF token to reduce the risk of false positives introduced by the CSRF rule. We implemented a configuration option that allows the agent to be disabled from within the application without removing the gem from the application. Weâ€™ve also been working on slimming down and standardizing the internal agent models.
