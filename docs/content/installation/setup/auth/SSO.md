## About Contrast and SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication service that allows access to multiple applications using one set of credentials. You can configure Contrast to use this service with a SAML 2.0 supported provider. 

> **Note:** For more information on the **SAML 2.0 specification**, [read this article](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf).

Authentication happens through an **identity provider (IdP)**. You may use your own generic IdP or one of many popular third-party providers, such as [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/), [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html) or [ADFS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897402.aspx).

## Before You Start

Set up an IdP (if you don't use one already), and then provide your metadata to connect to Contrast via an XML file or a **Metadata URL**.

## EOP

For Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) customers, the SuperAdmin configures SSO at the System level. 

> **Note:** If users are identified with a user ID rather than an email address, those accounts don’t automatically transfer over to the SSO configuration and must be recreated. 

### Get started

Contrast doesn't provide keys for SAML authentication. If you enable SSO without providing private keys, you're only able to perform IdP-initiated logins. You need to generate your own self-signed key using the Java Keytool:

```
keytool -genkeypair -alias some-alias -keypass changeit -keyalg RSA -keystore samlKeystore.jks
```

Use the [Encrypted Editor](installation-setupconfig.html#encrypt) to modify *saml.properties*, and update the values to the keystore you created in the previous step. 

```
 authenticator.saml.keystore.path                  : /path/to/samlKeystore.jks
 authenticator.saml.keystore.default.key           : some-alias
 authenticator.saml.keystore.passwordMap           : some-alias=changeit
 authenticator.saml.keystore.password              : changeit
```
 
Once you make the changes, restart Contrast so that it picks up the new keystore. 

### Configuration 

* In the Contrast application, go to the **user menu > System Settings > Authentication tab**, and select the link to **Change Authentication Method**.
* You may receive a warning regarding the implications of changing authentication. Please read it carefully before proceeding.

* In Step 1 of the setup wizard, select **Single Sign-On**.
* In Step 2, use the provided information to set up Contrast with your IdP. (You must also provide the Entity ID and Metadata URL in your IdP configuration.)
* Provide a name for your IdP as well as the associated metadata to connect to Contrast.
* If you want to automatically create new user accounts when someone make a SAML request to log in to Contrast, check the box to **Enable user provisioning**.
  * Use the dropdown menus to choose the **Default Organization Role** and **Default Application Access Group** for the new users. 
  * Add the **Accepted Domains** that must be used to trigger user provisioning (e.g., contrastsecurity.com).
* Test the configuration by clicking the **Test** button. If an error occurs, Contrast provides a debug log for troubleshooting. (This test only validates the metadata and Contrast's ability to connect to the IdP.)  
* Once the test is successful, click **Save**.

* Restart Contrast to apply the changes.

Once connected, you can return to the **SSO** tab to view and edit your settings. (You must retest and restart Contrast to apply the changes.) To return the organization back to the default configuration, select the link to Revert to Contrast-Managed Authentication and confirm the change.

#### Public and secret nodes

If [SuperAdmin was disabled](installation-setupinstall.html#disable-sa) during installation, you're provided with two sets of metadata: one for the public node and one for the secret node. You need to set up the configuration for both in the Contrast interface.

## SaaS 

For SaaS customers, the Contrast System Administrator configures authentication; however, an Organization Administrator may be granted the ability to override these settings, including SSO setup.

> **Note:** If users are identified with a user ID rather than an email address, those accounts don’t automatically transfer over to the SSO configuration and must be recreated.

### Configuration

* In the Contrast application, go to the **user menu > Organization Settings > Single Sign-On tab**, and click the link to **Get Started**.
* You may receive a warning dialog regarding the implications of changing authentication. Please read it carefully before proceeding.
* Use the provided information to set up Contrast with your IdP.
* Provide a name for your IdP as well as the associated metadata to connect to Contrast.
* If you want to automatically create new user accounts when someone make a SAML request to log in to Contrast, check the box to **Enable user provisioning**.
  * Use the dropdown menus to choose the **Default Organization Role** and **Default Application Access Group** for the new users. 
  * Add the **Accepted Domains** that must be used to trigger user provisioning (e.g., contrastsecurity.com). 
* Click **Test Connection** button to test the configuration. If an error occurs, Contrast provides a debug log for troubleshooting. (This test only validates the metadata and Contrast's ability to connect to the IdP.)  
* Once the test is successful, click **Save**.

<a href="assets/images/Sso-setup-org-settings.png" rel="lightbox" title="Configure SSO in Organization Settings"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/Sso-setup-org-settings.png"/></a>

* Open a **new** browser window, private browsing session or incognito window, and attempt the SSO login with your account. If you're unsuccessful, go back to the browser in which you're still logged in, disable SSO for the organization and then contact Customer Support. 

Once connected, you can return to the **SSO** tab to view and edit your settings. To return the organization back to the default configuration, select the link to **Revert to Contrast-Managed Authentication** and confirm the change. The Contrast SuperAdmin controls the default settings, and no configuration is necessary.

## Use SSO

For a user, SSO makes only a slight change to the login process. If SSO is configured, a checkbox appears on the Contrast login page. Checking it disables the password input field; only an email address is required. 

<a href="assets/images/SSOLogin.png" rel="lightbox" title="SSO Login"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/SSOLogin.png"/></a>

Contrast then verifies your email with the configured IdP, and directs you to the IdP login page. Once you submit your full SSO credentials and are successfully authenticated, you're logged in and directed back to the Contrast dashboard. If you try to sign in using SSO but don't have an account in Contrast, an error message informing you that your administrator must create your account appears on the login screen.

>**Note:** If Two-Step Verification is active for a user, that login process occurs **after** successful SSO authentication. See the article on [Two-Step Verification](admin-orgsecurity.html#security-tsv) for more information.

<!--
**Logging Out**
During IdP configuration, a logout landing page may be designated. This is simply a neutral place to direct users after logging out of their application(s). In the case that no page is specified, users will be directed to a default Contrast logout landing page.-->
