Contrast Security’s Quick Value delivery methodology is designed to reduce the time to achieve your desired business outcomes as well as to create a great onboarding experience for your team. After all, you purchased our products not only for our innovative, advanced technology, but more importantly, because we deliver a solution that is aligned with your business strategy and goals. To ensure that you don’t have to repeat the same information to every new team, information (e.g., your goals and desired timelines) learned in the sales stage gets passed to our onboarding team, and progress and learnings from the onboarding stage is communicated to Customer Support. We also simplify the initial deployment for your team by consolidating multiple activities into a handful of meetings.

This guide is a valuable reference and blueprint for your Project Manager and your team responsible for deploying Contrast’s Assess or Protect products. As you follow these steps, Contrast’s Customer Success representatives will continue to shepherd you through the setup and onboarding process. Overviews of features and workflows in Contrast Security include links to documentation and resources with additional details.

This guide is split into standalone sections for Assess and Protect. Each stage of the deployment has a brief introduction, a section on the recommended preparation that you can do to make the interactions with Contrast more productive, a summary of the objectives of the stage and a listing of the deliverables for that stage. By reading through the guidance for each stage, you can  also position your organization to improve its processes through the prescriptive Contrast Security Maturity Model. 


## Contrast Security Maturity Model

The Contrast Security Maturity Model is both a flexible roadmap and a scorecard to aid organizations in accelerating secure software development and production deployment. It serves as a framework to which to compare your current state and to provide a roadmap to mature to the final, desired maturity phase: Continuous.

The Contrast Security Maturity Model isn’t intended to be a one-size fits all model, and we realize that the ideal journey for you probably won’t  adhere strictly to our model. We designed the model to help guide your thinking and the dialogue we will have with you about your strategic vision (end-state) for application security, where you currently stand and the appropriate target state for your initial Contrast deployment.

To illustrate the stages of maturation when using Contrast, this maturity model describes the objectives, organizational reach, phases in the systems development life cycle (SDLC), vulnerability management, remediation responsibility, policy and governance, key performance indicators (KPIs) and business value.

Once introduced to Contrast in phase 1, an organization can easily move to phase 2, Adopted, by installing Assess agents in QA, engaging developers on the new approach and increasing visibility of application risk to provide initial value. Moving to phase 3, Standardized, involves implementing consistent security policy in Contrast - shifting vulnerability detection left in the SDLC - which reduces cost to fix vulnerabilities and improves the CISO-level view of risk. Entering the final, Continuous phase provides firm-wide security policy enforced through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and  using Protect to rebuff attacks, as well as the added benefits of reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) and accelerated time to market (TTM).

### Continuous phase

In the Continuous phase, Contrast is seamlessly integrated into the ecosystem of automated processes and tools. The following graphic is a theoretical example.
