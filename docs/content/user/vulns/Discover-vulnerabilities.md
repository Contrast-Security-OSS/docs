Contrast discovers any code flaws that are in your applications. These vulnerabilities are presented and classified with a severity level to help you prioritize and mark the vulnerabilities as needed. The **Vulnerabilities** page allows you to browse, search and filter through all an application's vulnerabilities. Click on each vulnerability for more details, including guidelines for determining how to resolve them to prevent an attack.

## How It Works

If a vulnerability is reported and Contrast has never seen it before, Contrast creates a new entry for that vulnerability. However, if that vulnerability already exists, Contrast updates the existing entry, issue count and number of days since it was last detected.

>**Example:** A vulnerability was reported to Contrast twice for one server. Instead of displaying each instance as a separate vulnerability, Contrast updates the existing entry and increments the count. Go to the **Notes** tab within this vulnerability to see a list of the servers in which this vulnerability was found.

## View Findings 

Contrast shows you all the vulnerabilities it's discovered including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, Path Traversal, XML External Entity Processing (XXE), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Java Deserialization and many more. Go to the main **Vulnerabilities** page to see all vulnerabilities across your portfolio, or go to the **Vulnerabilities** tab from the application's overview page to see a list of all vulnerabilities found in that application. 

> **Note:** For Contrast to find weaknesses and present findings, you must also exercise your application. You can then track, share and get remediation guidance for each vulnerability that Contrast reports.

The grid of discovered vulnerabilities provides basic information on each one, including: 

* Type, status and severity of the vulnerability
* Tutorial on how to fix it
* Line of code
* Ability to replay the attack

### Vulnerability status 

Contrast uses the following statuses for vulnerabilities to help you prioritize and manage findings. 

* **Reported:** The default for all discovered vulnerabilities.
* **Confirmed:** A user triaged the vulnerability and flagged it as a definitive risk.
* **Suspicious:** A user found a vulnerability that requires more investigation to determine its validity. 
* **Not a Problem:** Contrast requires a justification for this status. For example, the vulnerability is found to be a false positive or goes through an internal security control. 
* **Remediated:** The vulnerability is considered closed, but could be reopened (and returned to **Reported**) if rediscovered.
* **Fixed:** The vulnerability remains closed even if rediscovered, and will never be reported again.
* **Auto-remediated:** Contrast automatically remediated a vulnerability based on a [Remediation Policy](admin-policymgmt.html#remediate) set up by an administrator.

### Vulnerability severity 

Contrast classifies vulnerabilities in an application into five severity levels. The classifications are based on the likelihood and impact of a vulnerability in the application, from most to least severe:

* Critical
* High
* Medium
* Low
* Note

### Vulnerability Notes

In each vulnerabilities' **Notes** tab, Contrast provides further details about the identity, timing and location of the vulnerability, such as: 

* Build numbers
* Reporting servers
* Category 
* Security standards
