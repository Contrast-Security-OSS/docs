To begin using the Contrast API, you will need to retrieve your **API Key** from the server. To do this, you will need to log in to your TeamServer account and have the application email you a generated API Key.

1. Log in to TeamServer
2. Click the **Down** arrow next to your login name in the page header
3. Click on **API Key**
4. Click either **Email me the current API Key** or **Rotate the key and email me a new key**

Once you have retrieved your API Key, you will set this, along with your authorization credentials, as headers on each request to the API.

Header | Value
------ | -----
**API Key** | The API Key retrieved above (Plaintext)
**Authorization** | *Base64-encoded* credentials (username:*service-key*)
**Accept** | ```application/xml```, ```application/json```

## Sample Request

```
curl -HAccept:application/json -HAuthorization:test -HAPI-Key:test https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast/api/applications
