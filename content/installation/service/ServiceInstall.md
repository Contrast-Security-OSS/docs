The Contrast Service is packaged with the Ruby and Python agents and will run automatically when an instrumented Ruby on Rails, Flask or Django application is started. The Contrast Service is also available in a standalone Debian or RPM package. When installed using the standalone package, Contrast Service will be added to `systemctl` to automatically start when the server starts.
