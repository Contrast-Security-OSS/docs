tags: "installation ruby on rails agent service configuration"
-->

The Ruby agent and service use a YAML file to alter the agent behavior. Go to the Ruby [YAML Template](installation-rubyconfig.html#ruby-template) for fully formatted properties that you can copy and use in your own configuration files.

## Order of Precedence

The configuration file is called *contrast_security.yaml* wherever it's located. The Ruby agent and service load the configuration YAML from the following paths in order of precedence:

1. The current working directory (e.g., *./contrast_security.yaml*)
2. A subdirectory called *config*, which is the default for Ruby on Rails applications (e.g., *./config/contrast_security.yaml*)
3. Within the server's *etc/contrast* directory (e.g. */etc/contrast/contrast_security.yaml*)
3. Within the server's *etc* directory (e.g., */etc/contrast_security.yaml*)

## Service Configuration

The Ruby agent launches an executable on startup that also needs access to the configuration files. Since the service is generally launched by the Ruby agent process, it has access to the same configuration file as the agent. However, if the service is started independently, it will attempt to use the same load path described above for its configuration file. 

In other words, the service can share the application's configuration file, if (as is usually the case) the service's working directory is also the base directory of the Rails application. Both the agent and the service use the *./config/contrast_security.yaml* path. 

### Tagging

The Ruby agent supports the full array of tagging messages to the Contrast server. To apply these tags, you must update your configuration files. Tags in the configuration are comma-separated alphanumeric strings. Each tag will be attached to a corresponding message from the agent or service, depending which field is set. To see the appropriate properties for **server**, **application**, and **library** tags, go the given sections below. 

<!-- omit until assess is released 
For Trace tags, update the configuration of the agent. If there isn’t one, add a top-level `assess` field to the *contrast_security.yaml* file. Under that heading, add a `tags` field, which you may set to any comma-separated alphanumeric string.  
-->

## Configuration Options

### Enable the agent 

* **enable**: Only set this property if you want to turn off Contrast. Set to `true` to turn the agent on; set to `false` to turn the agent off.

### Contrast UI properties

Use the properties in this section to connect the agent to the Contrast UI.

* **api**: 
  * **url**: Set the URL for the Contrast UI. **Required.** <br> Example: *https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast*
  * **api_key**: Set the API key needed to communicate with the Contrast UI. **Required.**
  * **service_key**: Set the service key needed to communicate with the Contrast UI. It is used to calculate the Authorization header. **Required.**
  * **user_name**: Set the user name used to communicate with the Contrast UI. It is used to calculate the Authorization header. **Required.**

#### Certificate 

  * **certificate**: 
    * **enable**: If set to `false`, the agent will ignore the certificate configuration in this section.
    * **ca_file**: Set the absolute or relative path to a CA for communication with the Contrast UI using a self-signed certificate.
    * **cert_file**: Set the absolute or relative path to the Certificate PEM file for communication with the Contrast UI.
    * **key_file**: Set the absolute or relative path to the Key PEM file for communication with the Contrast UI.

### Contrast agent properties

All properties in this section must be put under the `agent` node, as shown in the [YAML template](installation-rubyconfig.html#ruby-template).

#### Logger

Define the following properties to set logging values. If these properties aren't defined, the agent uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.

* **agent**: Options for communicating between the agent and the service
  * **logger**:
    * **path**: Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file. While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file. <br> Example - */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    * **level**: Set the the log output level. Value options are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.
    * **progname**: Override the name of the process the agents uses in logs. <br> Example: Contrast Agent
    * **metrics**: Set to `true` for the agent to tag logs with "!AM!" for the metrics tool.

#### Security logger

Define the following properties to set security logging values. If not defined, the agent uses the security logging (CEF) values from the Contrast UI.

  * **security_logger**:
    * **path**: Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file. While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file. <br> Example: */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    * **level**: Set the log level for security logging. Valid options are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    * **roll_daily**: Change the Contrast logger from a file-sized based rolling scheme to a date-based rolling scheme. At midnight server time, the log from the previous day log is renamed to *file_name.yyyy-MM-dd*. You must set this flag to use the backups and size flags. <br> Note: This scheme does not have a size limit; manual log pruning is required. <br> Example: `false`
    * **roll_size**: Set the roll size for log files unless `agent.logger.roll_daily=true`. <br> Example: `100M`
    * **backups**: Set the number of backup files to keep. <br> Example: `10`

##### Syslog 

Define the following properties to set Syslog values. If the properties aren't defined, the agent uses the Syslog values from the Contrast UI.

  * **syslog**:
    * **enable**: Set to `true` to enable Syslog logging.
    * **ip**: Set the IP address of the Syslog server to which the agent should send messages.
    * **port**: Set the port of the Syslog server to which the agent should send messages.
    * **facility**: Set the facility code of the messages the agent sends to Syslog.
    * **severity_exploited**: Set the log level of Exploited attacks. Value options are `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.
    * **severity_blocked**: Set the log level of Blocked attacks. Value options are `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.
    * **severity_probed**: Set the log level of Probed attacks. Value options are `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.


#### Service

The following properties are used by the Contrast Service.

* **service**: 
  * **enable**: Set to `false` to disallow the service to be started, and effectively disable the agent, if read by the service. If the agent reads this property, it disallows service auto-start.
  * **socket**: If this property is defined, the service is listening on a Unix socket at the defined path. <br> Example: /tmp/service.sock
  * **host**: Set the the hostname or IP address of the Contrast service to which the Contrast agent should report. **Required.** <br> Example: `localhost`
  * **port**: Set the the port of the Contrast service to which the Contrast agent should report. **Required.** <br> Example: `30555`
    
##### Logger

The following properties are used by the logger in the Contrast service. If the properties are not defined, the service uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.

  * **logger**:
    * **path**: Set the location to which the Contrast service saves log output. If no log file exists at this location, the service creates one. <br> Example: */opt/Contrast/contrast_service.log* will create a log in the */opt/Contrast* directory.
    * **level**: Set the the log output level. Value options are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.
    * **progname**: Override the name of the process used in logs. <br> Example: Contrast Service

### Ruby-specific properties

The following configuration options allow you to fine-tune the Ruby agent.

* **ruby**: 
  * **track_frozen_sources**: Allow the agent to track frozen Objects returned by source methods. This configuration is on by default. 
  * **interpolate**: Allow the agent to track propagation through interpolated Strings. This configuration is on by default.
  * **disabled_agent_rake_tasks**: Define a comma-separated string of rake tasks in which to disable agent operation.

### Inventory properties 

Use the properties in this section to override the inventory features.

For **library** tags, update the configuration of the agent. If there isn’t one, add a top-level `inventory` field to the *contrast_security.yaml* file. Under that heading, add a `tags` field, which you may set to any comma-separated alphanumeric string. 

* **inventory**:
  * **enable**: Set to `false` to disable Inventory features in the agent.
