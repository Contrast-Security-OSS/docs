# Use the properties in this YAML file to configure a
# Contrast agent. Go to https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/ to
# determine the order of precedence for configuration values.
# ==============================================================================


# Only set this property if you want to turn off Contrast. Set to
# `true` to turn the agent on; set to `false` to turn the agent off.
# enable: true

# ==============================================================================
# api
# Use the properties in this section to connect the agent to the Contrast UI.
# ==============================================================================
api:

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the URL for the Contrast UI.
  url: https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the API key needed to communicate with the Contrast UI.
  api_key: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************

  # UI. It is used to calculate the Authorization header.
  user_name: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Set the path to which the agent should store the
  # currently used configuration from the Contrast UI.
  # last_config_path: ./tmp/config

  # ============================================================================
  # api.certificate
  # Use the following properties for communication
  # with the Contrast UI using certificates.
  # ============================================================================
  # certificate:

    # If set to `false`, the agent will ignore the
    # certificate configuration in this section.
    # enable: true

    # Set the absolute or relative path to a CA for communication
    # with the Contrast UI using a self-signed certificate.

# ==============================================================================
# agent
# Use the properties in this section to control the way and frequency
# with which the agent communicates to logs and the Contrast UI.
# ==============================================================================
agent:

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.logger
  # Define the following properties to set logging values.
  # If the following properties are not defined, the
  # agent uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  # logger:

    # Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file.
    # While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates
    # useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here
    # is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no
    # log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file.
    #  
    # Example - */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the
    # */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    # path: ./contrast_agent.log

    # Set the the log output level. Valid options are
    # `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Override the name of the process the agents uses in logs.
    # progname: Contrast Agent

    # Set to `true` for the agent to tag logs
    # with \"!AM!\" for the metrics tool.
    # metrics: true

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.security_logger
  # Define the following properties to set security
  # logging values. If not defined, the agent uses the
  # security logging (CEF) values from the Contrast UI.

    # Set the file to which the agent logs security events.
    # path: /.contrast/security.log

    # Set the log level for security logging. Valid options
    # are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Change the Contrast security logger from a file-sized based rolling
    # scheme to a date-based rolling scheme. At midnight server time,
    # the log from the previous day is renamed to *file_name.yyyy-MM-dd*.
    # Note - this scheme does not have a size limit; manual log
    # pruning will be required. This flag must be set to use the
    # backups and size flags. Value options are `true` or `false`.
    # roll_daily: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Specify the file size cap (in MB) of each log file.
    # roll_size: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Specify the number of backup logs that the agent will create before
    # Contrast cleans up the oldest file. A value of `0` means that no backups
    # are created, and the log is truncated when it reaches its size cap.
    #  
    # Note - this property must be used with
    # `agent.security_logger.roll_daily=false`; otherwise,
    # Contrast continues to log daily and disregard this limit.
    # backups: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET
