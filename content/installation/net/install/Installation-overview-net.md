The **Contrast .NET agent** analyzes the behavior of .NET web applications as users interact with these applications.

To start analyzing an application, download the .NET agent installer from the Contrast interface and run this installer on the server where the web application is deployed. You can then point your browser to the web application and use it as you normally would: click on links, submit forms using normal data, etc. The .NET agent's sensors will gather information about the application's security, architecture and libraries. The results of the agent's analysis can be viewed in the [Contrast interface](https://app.contrastsecurity.com).
