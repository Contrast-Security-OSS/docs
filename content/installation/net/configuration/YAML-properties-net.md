Contrast support YAML-based configuration for the .NET agent. This allows you to store configuration on disk with environment variable and CLI args. overrides.

> **Note:** While property formatting in YAML configuration files is shared by all Contrast agents, each agent must use its specified file. 

Configuration values use the following order of precedence: 

1. Corporate rule (e.g., expired license overrides `assess.enable`)
2. Command line value
3. Specific environmental variable
4. Generic environment variable value
5. User configuration file value
6. Contrast UI value
7. Default value
