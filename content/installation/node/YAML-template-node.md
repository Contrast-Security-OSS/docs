# ==============================================================================
# Use the properties in this YAML file to configure a
# Contrast agent. Go to https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/ to
# determine the order of precedence for configuration values.
# ==============================================================================


# Only set this property if you want to turn off Contrast. Set to
# `true` to turn the agent on; set to `false` to turn the agent off.
# enable: true

# ==============================================================================
# api
# Use the properties in this section to connect the agent to the Contrast UI.
# ==============================================================================
api:

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the URL for the Contrast UI.
  url: https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast

  # ============================================================================
  # api.certificate
  # Use the following properties for communication
  # with the Contrast UI using certificates.
  # ============================================================================
  # certificate:

    # If set to `false`, the agent will ignore the
    # certificate configuration in this section.
    # enable: true

    # Set the absolute or relative path to a CA for communication
    # with the Contrast UI using a self-signed certificate.

  # with the Contrast UI over a proxy.
  # ============================================================================
  # proxy:

    # Add a property value to determine if the agent should communicate with
    # the Contrast UI over a proxy. If a property value is not present, the
    # presence of a valid proxy host and port determines enabled status.
    # enable: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Set this property as an alternate for `scheme://host:port`. It takes
    # precedence over the other settings, if specified; however, an error
    # will be thrown if both the URL and individual properties are set.

  # agent.logger
  # Define the following properties to set logging values.
  # If the following properties are not defined, the
  # agent uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  # logger:

    # Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file.
    # While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates
    # useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here
    # is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no
    # log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file.
    #  
    # Example - */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the
    # */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    # path: ./contrast_agent.log

    # Set the the log output level. Valid options are
    # `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Set to `false` for the agent to always create a
    # new log file instead of appending and rolling.
    # append: true

    # Set to `true` to log to stdout. Set to `false`
    # for the agent to suppress output to stdout.
    # stdout: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.security_logger
  # Define the following properties to set security
  # logging values. If not defined, the agent uses the
  # security logging (CEF) values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  # security_logger:

    # Set the file to which the agent logs security events.
    # path: /.contrast/security.log

    # Set the log level for security logging. Valid options
    # are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.heap_dump
  # The following properties are used to trigger heap dumps from within
  # the agent to snapshot the behavior of instrumented applications.
  # ============================================================================
  # heap_dump:

    # Set to `true` for the agent to automatically
    # take heap dumps of the instrumented application.
    # enable: false

    # Set the location to which to save the heap dump files. If relative,
    # the path is determined based on the process' working directory.
    # path: contrast_heap_dumps

    # Set the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds,
    # after agent startup to begin taking heap dumps.
    # delay_ms: 10_000

    # Set the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, between each heap dump.

  # Override the reported application path.
  # path: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Add the name of the application group with which this

  # tags: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Define a set of key=value pairs (which conforms to RFC 2253) for
  # specifying user-defined metadata associated with the application. The
  # set must be formatted as a comma-delimited list of `key=value` pairs.
  # Example - "business-unit=accounting, office=Baltimore"
  # metadata: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Provide the ID of a session which already exists in the Contrast
  # UI. Vulnerabilities discovered by the agent are associated with
  # this session. If an invalid ID is supplied, the agent will be

  # mutually exclusive; if both are set, the agent will be disabled.
  # session_id: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Provide metadata which is used to create a new session ID in the
  # Contrast UI. Vulnerabilities discovered by the agent are associated
  # with this new session. This value should be formatted as key=value pairs
  # (conforming to RFC 2253). Available key names for this configuration
  # are branchName, buildNumber, commitHash, committer, gitTag, repository,
  # testRun, and version. This option and `application.session_id` are
  # mutually exclusive; if both are set the agent will be disabled.
