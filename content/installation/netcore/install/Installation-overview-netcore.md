The **Contrast .NET Core agent** analyzes the behavior of .NET Core web applications as users interact with them. To start analyzing an application, [download the .NET Core agent distribution](installation-netcoreinstall.html) from the Contrast UI, and set up the environment of your applications to use the agent. 

To exercise the agent, point your browser to the web application and use it as you normally would: click on links, submit forms using normal data, etc. The .NET Core agent's sensors will gather information about the application's security, architecture and libraries. You can view the results of the agent's analysis in the [Contrast UI](user-starthere.html#ui-intro).
