The **Contrast .NET Core agent** analyzes the behavior of .NET Core web applications as users interact with these applications.

To start analyzing an application, first download the .NET Core agent distribution from the [Contrast interface](https://app.contrastsecurity.com).  Then setup the environment of your applications to use the agent. 

To exercise the agent point your browser to the web application and use it as you normally would: click on links, submit forms using normal data, etc. 

The .NET Core agent's sensors will gather information about the application's security, architecture and libraries. The results of the agent's analysis can be viewed in the [Contrast interface](https://app.contrastsecurity.com).
