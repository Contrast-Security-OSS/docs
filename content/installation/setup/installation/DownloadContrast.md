## Set Up Contrast Hub

Contrast Hub is the central distribution system for customers to obtain installation media, release notes and licenses for Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) installations. EOP customers are provided with a [Hub](https://hub.contrastsecurity.com) account when their licenses are provisioned. If you're unsure about who holds access for your company, reach out to the [Contrast Support team](https://support.contrastsecurity.com/anonymous_requests/new).

## Download the Installer
Once you activate your Contrast Hub account, you can to download the Contrast installer for your operating system. <!-- How? -->

At this point, you can also download your Contrast license file. The license file is configured with a **SuperAdmin** account and a regular user account. You'll need the license to complete the installation of the Contrast application.

Our installer comes in two different flavors, one with Contrast cache data bundled and one without. Users who are air-gapped or have no internet connectivity should download the installer that has cache data bundled. Users that want to download our installer (labeled as NO_CACHE) **must** have internet connectivity to load the latest library data.
