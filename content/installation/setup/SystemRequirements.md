## Prepare for the Installation
The Contrast application for Enterprise on Premises (EOP) includes a Tomcat servlet container, a MySQL database instance and an AdoptOpenJDK Hotspot Java Virtual Machine. All of these components are embedded within the installation binary and deployed to a single server as part of the Contrast architecture. You should prepare the following prior to installing the application:

* System with adequate compute and memory resources based on guidance from our [sizing recommendations](installation-setup.html#size)
* Adherence to the system requirements specified below
* Installation of the MySQL run-time libraries

## MySQL Shared Libraries
To run Contrast, you must preconfigure your base operating system with a shared library for running MySQL. Depending on which operating system you deployed with Contrast, follow the installation options below:

Customers running **Centos** or **RHL**:

````
[contrast@myserver ~]# yum install libaio 
````

Customers running **Ubuntu** or **Debian**:

````
[contrast@myserver ~]# apt-get install libaio1 libaio-dev
````

Customers running **Windows** will need [Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784). MySQL added this as a requirement as part of the [MySQL 5.7.18 release](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-18.html#mysqld-5-7-18-packaging).
