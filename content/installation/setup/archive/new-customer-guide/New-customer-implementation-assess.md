Contrast Assess produces accurate results without dependence on application security experts. Accuracy comes from Contrast's patented Deep Security Instrumentation technology, which integrates the most effective elements of Interactive (IAST), Static (SAST); and Dynamic (DAST) application security testing technology; software composition analysis (SCA); and configuration analysis; and delivers them directly into applications.

Getting started with Assess can be as simple as [setting up the Contrast application  and installing an agent](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-setup.html#quick-start). Alternatively, the following steps prepare an organization to reap the full benefits of Assess and quantify the value they receive.

## Steps

The following steps introduce Contrast to an organization, integrate it into their workflow and quantify the value it has brought to the initial adopters of the technology.

1. Kickoff: Introductions, align vision and quantify success metrics.
2. Solution Architecture: Tailor implementation.
3. Project Plan: Agree on details and timing.
4. TeamServer Preparation: Get ready to add applications.
5. Application Baseline: Initial analysis of applications.
6. Vulnerability Management: How vulnerabilities are analyzed, communicated and tracked
7. Contrast Business Review: Quantify the gained value.

Contrast’s Customer Success team will continue to work with you to help your organization increasingly gain value from the time and money you’ve invested.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles may represent one or more people. (One person may play multiple roles.)

* Project Manager: Works with Contrast on deployment schedule, tracks internal milestones and task completion, and is responsible for internal communications.
* TeamServer Administrator:	Prepares technical environment; manages users, access controls, reports, upgrades and communications; interfaces with Contrast Support.
* Application Security Lead: Creates and governs policy, security controls and the vulnerability management process.
* Development Leads: Manages vulnerability remediation and build integration.
* Exec Sponsor - Security: Executive from the security group who oversees Contrast deployment.
* Exec Sponsor - Development: Executive from the development group who oversees Contrast deployment.


## Kickoff

The focus of the Kickoff meeting is to introduce all the parties, and get everyone aligned on the current business issues, reasons for purchasing Contrast, strategic vision for Contrast as well as the scope and success metrics for the initial applications to be onboarded. We will also review the Contrast Quick Value deployment methodology, roles and responsibilities, and plan for the next stage: Solution Architecture.

### Objectives

* Verify the desired Business Outcomes as well as their KPIs.
* Document the desired state for the initial phase.
* Familiarize customers with Contrast’s Quick Value deployment methodology.
* Ensure that all the key project roles are filled.
* Review the the Intake document for the Solution Architecture meeting.
* Review the Contrast Security Maturity Model.

### Preparation

In advance of this meeting:

* Pre-meeting with the primary stakeholder, who will participate in each role in this deployment, to become aligned with our deployment methodology and initial phase scope, success factors and project risks.
* Each attendee should have [a high-level understanding of Contrast Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gviz-SiJGWk).

## Solution Architecture

In this critical stage of the project, we will gather information about your current state, then recommend the Contrast best practices that are best suited to address your specific process and technical needs for the initial phase (“First Win”). This will require a detailed, technical conversation on requirements as well as process and system design.

### Objectives

* Understand the application security landscape (e.g., SDLC, technical environment, security policies, vulnerability lifecycle).
* Finalize requirements for the initial phase (“First Win”), which include security policy, vulnerability management, metrics/reporting, integrations, user/application onboarding, training and access control.
* Document vulnerability management process.
* Determine tags to add to inventory (e.g., servers, applications, vulnerabilities).
* Designate up to three applications to onboard for your initial baseline.

### Preparation

* A list of candidate applications to be included as part of your initial baseline. 
* Meet the technical requirements for [Java](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-java.html#java-supported), [.NET](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-net.html#net-supported), [Node](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-node.html#node-supported) or [Ruby](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-ruby.html#ruby-supported).
* A list of tools used by development teams: integrated development environments (IDEs), bug trackers, continuous integration and access management.
* A workflow of how vulnerabilities are triaged, managed and communicated to developers.
Known [security controls](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/admin-policymgmt.html#security).

### Deliverables

* Finalize requirements for security policy and governance, vulnerability management, metrics/dashboards, access control, integrations, training and user/application onboarding.
* Architectural description of [how Contrast integrates with the tools](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/admin-orgintegrations.html) and processes of the initial applications: IDEs, bug trackers, continuous integration and access management.

## Project Plan

Once all the requirements and solution design are finalized in the Solution Architecture stage, it’s time to map out a project plan. Contrast will select one of its proven project plan templates, and collaborate with you to tailor it to your specific needs.

### Objectives
