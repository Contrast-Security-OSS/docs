## How It Works

WebGoat is a a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) for demonstrating application security principles. Once you download WebGoat, you can download and install the Contrast Java agent from the Contrast UI. The Java agent will then Assess your WebGoat application, and provide the results in the **Vulnerabilities** page.
