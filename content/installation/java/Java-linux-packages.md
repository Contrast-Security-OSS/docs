## About Installation with System Package Managers

The Contrast Java agent may be installed using system package managers. Unlike the *jar* file you can download from the Contrast UI, the Contrast Java agent *jar* installed by system package managers isn't preconfigured with connection parameters; instead, you must configure the Java agent using a [configuration file](installation-javaconfig.html).

### The Exec Helper package 

Some System Administrators may also want install the optional Exec Helper package for the Contrast Java agent, which configures the system to always enable Contrast whenever you execute `java`. Instead of a typical Contrast installation that requires users to configure their Java services to include the Contrast Java agent, the `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper` package intercepts all new `java` processes, and automatically configures the process to use Contrast. 

This option is ideal for some scenarios in which Contrast must support legacy infrastructure but your Java application server configuration isn't well understood. However, in most scenarios, administrators want more granular control over their Contrast configurations.

## Installation for Ubuntu-Based Systems

To install the Contrast Java agent for Ubuntu-based systems, complete the following steps. 

* Configure your system to Contrast's distribution-agnostic Debian repository. 

```
curl https://contrastsecurity.jfrog.io/contrastsecurity/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://contrastsecurity.jfrog.io/contrastsecurity/debian-staging/ all contrast" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/contrast-staging.list
```

* Once you've finished configuration, install the Contrast Java agent.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt- get install `contrast-java-agent`
```

* Edit the */etc/contrast/contrast-java-config.yaml* file to configure Contrast Java agent to connect to the Contrast application. <!-- (Go to the YAML [Configuration doc](_________) for more info.) -->

> **Note:** To complete the agent installation process, follow the instructions for the [container](installation-javainstall.html) of your choice. 


### Add the Exec Helper package 

The Exec Helper for the Contrast Java agent supports Ubuntu LTS distributions Trusty, Xenial and Bionic. Complete the following steps to install the package. 

* Before you install the package, use the following command to verify that you have already installed the Contrast Java agent. 

```
dpkg -s contrast-java-agent
```

* If it isn't installed, follow the instructions in the **Installation for Ubuntu-Based Systems** section to install and configure the `contrast-java-agent` package. 

* To install the Exec Helper from Contrast's Debian repository, configure your system to use the repository tailored for your Ubuntu LTS distribution.

```
curl https://contrastsecurity.jfrog.io/contrastsecurity/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://contrastsecurity.jfrog.io/contrastsecurity/debian-staging/ $(bash -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo $DISTRIB_CODENAME') contrast" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/contrast-staging.list
```

* Once you've finished configuration, install the `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper` package.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install contrast-java-agent-exec-helper
```

> **Note:** The Exec Helper package expects to find the Contrast Java agent at */opt/contrast/contrast.jar*, where the `contrast-java-agent` package installs it. If the Contrast *jar* file has a different path, use environment variable `CONTRAST_JAVA_AGENT_PATH` to configure `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper`.


## Installation for Red Hat-Based Systems

Complete the following steps to install the Contrast Java agent for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS versions 5, 6 and 7.

* To install Java agent from Contrast's Yum repository, configure your system to use the repository.

```
OSREL=$(rpmquery -E "%{rhel}")
sudo -E tee /etc/yum.repos.d/contrast.repo << EOF
[contrast]
name=contrast repo
baseurl=https://contrastsecurity.jfrog.io/contrastsecurity/rpm-staging/centos-$OSREL/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
EOF
```

* Once you've finished configuration, install the Contrast Java agent.

```
yum install contrast-java-agent
```

* Edit the */etc/contrast/contrast-java-config.yaml* file to configure Contrast Java agent to connect to the Contrast application. <!-- (Go to the YAML [Configuration doc](_________) for more info.) -->

> **Note:** To complete the agent installation process, follow the instructions for the [container](installation-javainstall.html) of your choice. 

### Add the Exec Helper package 

Before you install the package, use the following command to verify that you have already installed the Contrast Java agent.

```
yum list installed contrast-java-agent
```

* If it isn't installed, follow the instructions in the **Red Hat-Based Systems** section to install and configure the `contrast-java-agent` package. 

* As you already configured your system to use the Contrast Yum repository when you installed the `contrast-java-agent` package, you can install the `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper` package.

```
yum install contrast-java-agent-exec-helper
```

> **Note:** The Exec Helper package expects to find the Contrast Java agent at */opt/contrast/contrast.jar*, where the `contrast-java-agent` packages installs it. If the Contrast *jar* file has a different path, use environment variable `CONTRAST_JAVA_AGENT_PATH` to configure the `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper`.


## Remove the Agent

If you need to uninstall the Java agent, use the appropriate command for each package. 

* To remove the `contrast-java-agent` package, run `apt-get remove contrast-java-agent`. 

* To remove the `contrast-java-agent-exec-helper` package, run `apt-get remove contrast-java-agent-exec-helper`.
