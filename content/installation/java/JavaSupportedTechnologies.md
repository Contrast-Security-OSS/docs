### Note for Proguard Users

[Proguard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proguard/files/) includes Java bytecode optimization features which break basic assumptions that runtime agents like Contrast rely on. Proguard users that want to protect their applications with Contrast need to avoid these optimizations by using Proguard's [-dontoptimize](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard/manual/usage#dontoptimize) configuration option.
