## About PII Masking 

Some customers have sensitive information in their applications that the Java agent captures and sends to the Contrast application. Consequently, other users in the same [organization](user-account.html#user-permissions) may view personally identifiable information (PII) - including passwords, security keys and other sensitive data - in the Contrast UI. 

## How It Works

Contrastâ€™s PII masking feature removes the sensitive information and replaces it with a masking key in the Contrast application, while still allowing the agent to provide protection. The feature handles three types of user input data: **body**, **header** and **query parameter**. Body PII masking is activated using a Boolean configuration property, and will mask all request bodies. Header and query parameter masking will only mask the value of the header or query parameter defined in the configuration property.

## Properties

The following properties control and define the masking. 

* `contrast.report.body`: Currently exists for masking data in the body when set to `false`. Provided as a Boolean. Defaults to `true`.
* `contrast.report.headers.mask`: Added to mask data found in the header values. Provided as a comma-separated string with spaces omitted. Defaults to `empty`, which means no masking.
* `contrast.report.query.parameter.mask`: Added to mask data found in the query parameters. Provided as a comma-separated string. Defaults to `empty`, which means no masking.

## Masking Keys

The following string values are sent in place of sensitive information.

* **Body:** {body-omitted-by-contrast}
* **Header:** {header-value-omitted-by-contrast}
* **Parameter:** {query-parameter-value-omitted-by-contrast}
* **Details:** {value-omitted-by-contrast} <br> 
 Most rules have details that contain additional rule-specific information. In some cases, these details have sensitive information that requires masking. Contrast will then use the given mask.
