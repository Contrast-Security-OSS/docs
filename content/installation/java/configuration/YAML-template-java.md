```yaml
# ==============================================================================
# Use the properties in this YAML file to configure a
# Contrast agent. Go to https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/ to
# determine the order of precedence for configuration values.
# ==============================================================================


# Only set this property if you want to turn off Contrast. Set to
# `true` to turn the agent on; set to `false` to turn the agent off.
# enable: true

# ==============================================================================
# api
# Use the properties in this section to connect the agent to the Contrast UI.
# ==============================================================================
api:

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the URL for the Contrast UI.
  url: https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the API key needed to communicate with the Contrast UI.
  api_key: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ********************** REQUIRED **********************
  # Set the service key needed to communicate with the Contrast
  # UI. It is used to calculate the Authorization header.

  # UI. It is used to calculate the Authorization header.
  user_name: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ============================================================================
  # api.proxy
  # Use the following properties for communication
  # with the Contrast UI over a proxy.
  # ============================================================================
  # proxy:

    # Add a property value to determine if the agent should communicate with
    # the Contrast UI over a proxy. If a property value is not present, the
    # presence of a valid proxy host and port determines enabled status.
    # enable: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Set the proxy host. It must be set with port and scheme.
    # host: localhost

    # Set the proxy port. It must be set with host and scheme.
    # port: 1234

    # Set the proxy scheme (e.g., `http` or
    # `https`). It must be set with host and port.
    # scheme: http

    # Set this property as an alternate for `scheme://host:port`. It takes
    # precedence over the other settings, if specified; however, an error
    # will be thrown if both the URL and individual properties are set.
    # url: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Set the proxy user.
    # user: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Set the proxy password.

# agent
# Use the properties in this section to control the way and frequency
# with which the agent communicates to logs and the Contrast UI.
# ==============================================================================
# agent:

  # Set the amount of time to run the agent before shutting down itself
  # (in milliseconds). A negative value disables scheduled shutdown.
  # shutdown_time_ms: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Set to `true` to deinstrument classes on shutdown. If this is not enabled,
  # the agent disables sensors on shutdown, but leaves instrumentation.
  # deinstrument_on_shutdown: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.logger
  # Define the following properties to set logging values.
  # If the following properties are not defined, the
  # agent uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  # logger:

    # Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file.
    # While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates
    # useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here
    # is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no
    # log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file.
    #  
    # Example - */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the
    # */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    # path: ./contrast_agent.log

    # Set the the log output level. Valid options are
    # `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Set to `true` to log to stdout. Set to `false`
    # for the agent to suppress output to stdout.
    # stdout: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Set to `true` to log to STDERR.
    # stderr: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Change the Contrast logger from a file-sized based rolling scheme
    # to a date-based rolling scheme. At midnight server time, the log
    # from the previous day log is renamed to *file_name.yyyy-MM-dd*.
    # Note - this scheme does not have a size limit; manual log pruning is
    # required. You must set this flag to use the backups and size flags.
    # roll_daily: false

    # Set the roll size for log files unless `agent.logger.roll_daily=true`.
    # roll_size: 100M

    # Set the number of backup files to keep.
    # backups: 10

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.security_logger
  # Define the following properties to set security
  # logging values. If not defined, the agent uses the
  # security logging (CEF) values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  # security_logger:

    # Set the file to which the agent logs security events.
    # path: /.contrast/security.log

    # Set the log level for security logging. Valid options
    # are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Change the Contrast security logger from a file-sized based rolling
    # scheme to a date-based rolling scheme. At midnight server time,
    # the log from the previous day is renamed to *file_name.yyyy-MM-dd*.
    # Note - this scheme does not have a size limit; manual log
    # pruning will be required. This flag must be set to use the
    # backups and size flags. Value options are `true` or `false`.
    # roll_daily: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Specify the file size cap (in MB) of each log file.
    # roll_size: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # Specify the number of backup logs that the agent will create before
    # Contrast cleans up the oldest file. A value of `0` means that no backups
    # are created, and the log is truncated when it reaches its size cap.
    #  
    # Note - this property must be used with
    # `agent.security_logger.roll_daily=false`; otherwise,
    # Contrast continues to log daily and disregard this limit.
    # backups: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # ==========================================================================
    # agent.security_logger.syslog
    # Define the following properties to set Syslog values. If the properties
    # are not defined, the agent uses the Syslog values from the Contrast UI.
    # ==========================================================================
    # syslog:

      # Set to `true` to enable Syslog logging.

  # ============================================================================
  # agent.java
  # The following properties apply to any Java agent-wide configurations.
  # ============================================================================
  # java:

    # Configure the Java agent to skip its application discovery
    # algorithm, and instead associate all libraries, vulnerabilities,
    # and web traffic to a single application with the name specified
    # by this property. This configuration is preferred when deploying
    # Java SE applications with embedded web servers (e.g., applications
    # built with Spring Boot, Dropwizard, and embedded Jetty). When used
    # with an application server, this configuration associates all
    # web traffic with the single, standalone application, including
    # web traffic handled by application server-hosted endpoints that
    # would not be associated with a discovered application otherwise.
    #  
    # Note - This settings takes preferences
    # over the `application.name` setting.
    # standalone_app_name: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

    # By default, the Java agent visits all classes at startup to look
    # for vulnerabilities, which the agent may detect by scanning a
    # class (e.g., hardcoded passwords). Set this property to `false`
    # to disable the default behavior. If disabled, the agent will
    # only visit classes which are likely to require sensors; this
    # can improve application startup time, but may produce fewer
    # findings (most likely findings that require static analysis).
    #  
    # scan_all_classes: true

    # By default, the Java agent deeply inspects all JAR and WAR files loaded
    # by the JVM to build a comprehensive understanding of the type hierarchy.
    # This understanding allows Contrast to instrument sensors into types
    # that it might have overlooked. In most cases, this produces a slight
    # increase in accuracy at the cost of increased application startup
    # time. Set this property to `false` to disable this level of inspection.
    #  
    # scan_all_code_sources: true

# ==============================================================================
# inventory
# Use the properties in this section to override the inventory features.
# ==============================================================================

  # be formatted as a semicolon-delimited list. \n Example - path1;path2;path3
  # library_dirs: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # Set the maximum archive unpacking depth when analyzing libraries.
  # library_depth: 10

  # Set to `false` to disable inventory features in the agent.

  # Apply a list of labels to vulnerabilities and
  # preflight messages. Labels must be formatted as a
  # comma-delimited list. \n Example - label1, label2, label3
  # tags: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  # ============================================================================
  # assess.sampling
  # Use the following properties to control sampling in the agent.
  # ============================================================================
  # sampling:

    # Set to `false` to disable sampling.
    # enable: true

    # This property indicates the number of requests
    # to analyze in each window before sampling begins.
    # baseline: 5

    # This property indicates that every *nth*
    # request after the baseline is analyzed.
    # request_frequency: 10

    # This property indicates the duration for which a sample set is valid.
    # window_ms: 180_000

  # ============================================================================
  # assess.rules
  # Use the following properties to control simple rule configurations.
  # ============================================================================
  # rules:

    # Define a list of Assess rules to disable in the agent.
    # The rules must be formatted as a comma-delimited list.
