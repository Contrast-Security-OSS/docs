## General Properties
Generate a list of general properties directly from the command line using the Contrast agent JAR by executing `java -jar path/to/contrast.jar properties`. You could also generate this markdown file directly from the command line by executing `java -jar contrast.jar properties --generate-markdown --write-to-file=/path/to/file.md`. Combine the command with tools like *grep* to search for commands. 

> **Example:**
`java -jar path/to/contrast.jar properties | grep -A5 "proxy"` would yield a list of proxy-related properties.

## Logging

By default, diagnostic logging is enabled, but set to the INFO level. It uses a rolling file appender scheme to keep up to 1 GB of logs on the File System, broken up into 10MB log files. Logging has a small performance impact, but generates useful information for debugging Contrast. To change how logging functions, you can adjust the following system properties.

### Assessment mode

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.level | Log output level<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** info</br> |
| contrast.log | Enable *diagnostic logging*. This hurts performance, but generates useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here will be the location to which log output is saved. If no log file exists at this location, one will be created. For instance, */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* will create a log in the */opt/Contrast* directory and rotate it automatically as needed.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** ${HOME}/.contrast/logs/contrast.log</br> |
| contrast.log.backups | Specify the number of "backup" logs that will be created before Contrast will clean up the oldest file. This value has a cap of 100, meaning no more than 100 log files can be stored on the file system at one time. A value of 0 here means that no backups will be created and the log will simply be truncated when it reaches its size cap.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 100</br> |
| contrast.log.daily | Change the Contrast logger from a file sized based rolling scheme to a date based rolling scheme. At midnight serve time, the previous day's log will be renamed to file_name.yyyy-MM-dd. Note, this scheme does not have a size limit, so manual log pruning will be required. This flag must be set to use the backups and size flags.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.log.size | Specify the file size cap, in MB, of each log file. This value has a cap of 10, meaning no more than 10MB will be logged to a single file.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 10</br> |

### Defend mode

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.security.log.backups | Specify the number of "backup" logs that will be created before Contrast will clean up the oldest file. This value has a cap of 100, meaning no more than 100 log files can be stored on the file system at one time. A value of 0 here means that no backups will be created and the log will simply be truncated when it reaches its size cap.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** false</br> |
| contrast.security.log.daily | Change the Contrast security logger from a file sized based rolling scheme to a date based rolling scheme. At midnight server time, the previous day's log will be renamed to file_name.yyyy-MM-dd. Note, this scheme does not have a size limit, so manual log pruning will be required. This flag must be set to use the backups and size flags.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.security.log.file | The file to which logging of security events will occur. By default, this file is located at <working_directory>/security.log.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** ${HOME}/.contrast/logs/security-events.log</br> |
| contrast.security.log.level | Set the log level for security logging. Values include: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, off. Setting this to off will disable security logging.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** info</br> |
| contrast.security.log.size | Specify the file size cap, in MB, of each log file. This value has a cap of 10, meaning no more than 10MB will be logged to a single file. By default, this value is '10'.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 10</br> |

### Diagnostics

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.assess.autodetect.controls | boolean to enable/disable detecting security sensors<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.assess.secondorder.canary | A value that will be fed by attack testing tools in order to test stored XSS or other second-order injection attacks to be detected coming out of databases<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** null (disabled)</br> |
| contrast.savebytecode | Save the *before/after bytecode* of classes where sensors have been added.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.saveresults | controls when Contrast findings are saved locally<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** never</br> |
| contrast.scoped.jarverifier | controls whether the JarInputStream verifier is disabled during our scoped operations<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** false</br> |

### Proxy settings

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.proxy.protocol | Proxy protocol, e.g. http, https<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| proxy.auth | Override authentication type for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |
| proxy.fingerprint | Override Fingerprint for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |
| proxy.host | Override Host for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |
| proxy.pass | Override Password for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |
| proxy.port | Override Port for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |
| proxy.user | Override User for Proxy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** configured system property</br> |

### Performance

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.assess.threshold.entries | The maximum number of vulnerabilities per rule type that can be discovered within a period defined by contrast.assess.threshold.period<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 100</br> |
| contrast.assess.threshold.period | The period, in seconds, in which a maximum number of vulnerabilities per rule type can be discovered<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 60 (seconds)</br> |
| contrast.blacklist | path to file that lists blacklisted classes<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.cache.hierarchy | boolean to enable/disable hierarchy cache<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.concurrent.requests | average number of concurrent users logged into the application at any one time<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** 20</br> |
| contrast.hierarchy.rebuild | boolean to trigger rebuilding/resetting the hierarchy cache<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.hierarchy.update | boolean to trigger updating the hierarchy cache<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.http.analysis.parameters | boolean to enable/disable analysis of HTTP parameters<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.j2ee.classcache | boolean to enable/disable caching of instrumented classes<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.preflight.open | Typically, the Contrast Agent uses a preflight hashing mechanism to avoid duplicate reporting, reducing load on TeamServer. Occasionally, this process can be overwhelmed, and TeamServer cannot reply quickly enough. In this case, in order to avoid losing any vulnerability data, the Agent will send any reports that are being filtered by preflight. While TeamServer can usually recover and resume preflight, it sometimes falls behind (for instance if the application being monitored is placed under a load test). To ensure that TeamServer has a chance to catch up, you can set this flag to false; however, it is worth noting that doing so may result in lost vulnerability information as all reports will be disregarded.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** false</br> |
| contrast.sampling | Enable and configure *sampling mode*. By default, just placing this flag will result in a *baseline* (how many times a request should be analyzed before it is considered sampled) and *frequency* (how often after the baseline has been established should new samples be taken) of **5** and a *sampling window* (how long the baseline is valid, in seconds) of **180 seconds**. This means that after the same request has been seen five times in 180 seconds, it will only be analyzed every subsequent fifth time. You can customize this further by setting the value to "#,#,#". In this case, the baseline will be set to the first number, the frequency second, and the window third. Note that if you choose to customize any value, you must provide all three inputs.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** Not used if flag is not specified. If just the flag is specified (without the values): 5,5,180</br> |

### Policy

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.policy | If you set this value to a file or URL, Contrast will use it in addition to the pre-packaged security policy. This means that rules from both the standard Contrast policy and your custom policy will be used, with conflicts being resolved in favor of the external policy, i.e. if two sources have the same ID, one in the internal policy and one in the external, the external source will be used.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.policy.overrides | Same functionality as contrast.policy, but policies listed here have a higher priority, meaning that conflicts will be resolved in favor of the overrides policy, i.e. if two sources have the same ID, one in the policy and one in the override, the override source will be used. <br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.policy.standalone | If you set this value to a file or URL, Contrast will use it instead of the pre-packaged security policy. For more information about rule customization, please contact your account manager.<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |
| contrast.rules.jar | If you set this value to a .jar file or URL, Contrast will load the rules from it (Java 6+ only)<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** not used; this property must be set in order to be active</br> |

| contrast.identitytags | boolean to enable/disable identity tags<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |
| contrast.propagators | boolean enable/disable loading of propagators from policy<br>**DEFAULT VALUE:** true</br> |

## Updates

>**Note:** These options only apply to the Java 1.6 agent.

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
| contrast.forceupdate |  If you set this value to *true*, Contrast will download the latest available agent from whatever TeamServer the current agent was downloaded from. This feature is useful if you've changed the configuration of the agent and want to ensure that all current agents pick up this change. By default, the agent will smart update on application server restart, downloading a new agent from TeamServer if the TeamServer has been upgraded since the last time the application server was started. |
