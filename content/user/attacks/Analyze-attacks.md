The **Attacks** page contains the record of all attacks seen by applications that have Contrast Protect enabled. These attacks include both monitored attacks as well as blocked attacks.

## Attack Composition

Attacks are groups of [attack events](user-attacks.html#monitor) coming from a single IP address over a sustained period of time. An attack can be comprised of events that target multiple applications and servers as well as multiple attack types, such as SQL Injection, Command Injection or specific CVEs. An attack ends once Contrast agents no longer see attack events for a period of time. If Contrast sees new attack events from the same IP address after an attack is closed, a new attack is created. 

## View Attacks

Go to the **Attacks** tab in the **Attacks** page to view all attacks that have occurred in your organization. Contrast organizes the components of each attack into the following columns. 

* **Source IP:** The IP address from which the attack is originating. 

* **Status:** The current status of the attack. 

 An attack status is determined by the status of the attack events within the attack. The status is as "Probed" if all events have a "Probed" status, "Blocked" if all events have either a "Blocked" or "Probed" status, and "Exploited" if any event has an "Exploited" status.

* **Application:** Any applications that saw attack events from the IP address while the attack was active.

* **Server:** Any server that saw attack events from the IP address while the attack was active.

* **Rule:** Any attack type identified from the IP address while the attack was active.

* **Start:** The timestamp of the first attack event seen from the IP address during the attack timeframe.

* **End:** The timestamp of the last attack event seen from the IP address during the attack timeframe.

* **Events:** The number of attack events that comprise the attack.

## Manage Attacks 

In the **Attacks** page, use the row dropdown menu to [blacklist an IP address](admin-policymgmt.html#ip), suppress the attack, or export the attack details into a CSV or XML-formatted spreadsheet. Tag or suppress multiple attacks by checking the boxes in the grid rows, and selecting the appropriate icons in the batch action menu above the grid. 

> **Note:** If you choose to blacklist an IP address, you must enter a name for the new policy and select a timeframe for expiration in the dialog that appears.  

### Manage attack events

In an attack **Overview** tab, use the row dropdown menu to [add an exclusion](admin-policymgmt.html#exclude), [create a virtual patch](admin-policymgmt.html#patch), [blacklist an IP address](admin-policymgmt.html#ip), [add a Protect Rule](admin-policymgmt.html#protect) or suppress the event. Tag or suppress multiple attack events by checking the boxes in the grid rows, and selecting the appropriate icons in the batch action menu above the grid. 

You can also perform each of these actions by clicking on the event, and selecting the appropriate icon in the expanded description.
