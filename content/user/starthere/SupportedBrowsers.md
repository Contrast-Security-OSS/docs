The Contrast interface is a HTML 5-based browser application based on AngularJS, and works well with the latest version of any modern browser. Contrast actively tests the interface with the following browsers and versions:
* IE 11+ <br> (After December 2017, Contrast no longer supports IE 10.)
* Safari 8+
* Chrome 40+
* Firefox 37+

Opera and older versions of Firefox, IE, and Safari browsers may still operate well, but some features might not display as intended.
