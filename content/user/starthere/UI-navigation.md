The Contrast interface is used for configuring Contrast agent deployments and triaging application weaknesses as we continuously monitor them. The UI provides a single view to analyze application vulnerabilities, discover vulnerable and out-of-date third-party libraries, and detect attacks. We also provide visibility into various environments to see how an application’s hidden risks are being handled through the development cycle. 

To get the best experience out of Contrast, familiarize yourself with the components of the UI that you'll use most often. 

Here at Contrast, we work hard to engage and guide our users. Don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:andria.mattsen@contrastsecurity.com,terra.caussin@contrastsecurity.com">give us some suggestions</a>! 

## Navigation

The top navigation bar is persistent as you move through Contrast - giving easy access to core pieces at any time. There are two versions of the top navigation bar depending on your system role and access levels. Most users will interface with the organization view. Users with system administration capabilities will have the luxury of toggling between the organization view and system administration view.

### Organization view

### System Administration view

If you have system administration capabilities, you will be able to switch from the organization view to the system administration view in the user menu. When doing so, the top navigation bar changes. This is only available on an Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) installation.

## Grid Actions

Contrast displays primary assets and findings - applications, servers, libraries, vulnerabilities and attacks - in table format with rows of data. These grids have a built-in search mechanism to easily get to the data you need. You can also use the quick views to see data by the most frequently used categories. 

<a href="assets/images/Vulnerabilities-grid.png" rel="lightbox" title="View vulnerabilities in the grid"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/Vulnerabilities-grid.png"/></a>

Each table offers column sorting to alter the ordering of the data in exactly the way you want. In addition, tables offer actions that allow you to perform operations on individual rows or in bulk by selecting many rows. 

### Sorting and filtering 

Sort and filter data in the grids for better focus. Use the dropdown menu above the grids to select a quick view of findings in certain categories, such as licensed applications or open vulnerabilities. You can also use the filters in the grids to find specific sets of findings, such as servers with the same tags. The dropdown menu above the right corner of the grid lets you sort all the findings in your current by certain categories, such as application name, in ascending or descending order.

## The Details 

From any main page, you can drill into an asset or finding by clicking on its name within the table row. Contrast highlights metrics on the asset or finding for a quick snapshot of core data. Navigate the sub-pages to get more details on related pieces, view activity more closely, access review policy, or capture comments and collaborate with team members.
