## How It Works

Notifications provide a mechanism for Contrast users to be alerted to specific situations, such as the discovery of a vulnerability or an attack on an application. Contrast offers several out-of-the-box notifications with settings that you can tailor as needed. 

There are two primary channels available for notifications: Email and In Contrast. 

* **In Contrast:** Notifications are available directly in the Contrast application. View your notifications by clicking the bell icon in the top menu bar.
* **Email:** Notifications are available if mail has been set up by your Organization Administrator. 

> **Note:** Organization Administrators can adjust notification settings for [integrations](admin-orgintegrations.html#integration-start) in your organization. For more information, go to the [Notifications management](admin-orgsettings.html#org-notify) article. 

## Update Settings 

To change your notification settings, log in to Contrast, and go to the **User menu > Your Account > Notifications tab**. Click in the **Subscriptions** field to choose the application(s) for which you want to receive notifications; the default selection is "All Applications". Use the toggles in the **In Contrast** and **Email** columns to enable or disable the following subscriptions. 

* **Active Attack:** There is an active attack on an application with **Protect** enabled. 
* **New Vulnerability:** Contrast has detected a new vulnerability. Click in the field to receive notifications for specific severity levels or "Library"; the default selection is "All".
* **Server Offline:** Contrast can't reach a server. 
* **New Comment:** A team member commented on a finding. 
* **New Asset:** A new asset to which you have [access](user-account.html#user-permissions) has been onboarded. Click in the field to set this notification for "Application" or "Server"; the default selection is "All".
* **Email:** A daily summary of Contrast activities. (Email row only)

> **Note:** Click on the link at the top of the configuration form to **Restore Defaults**.
