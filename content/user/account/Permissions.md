The **Permissions** page provides a detailed view of the assigned permissions for both the organization and the applications to which you have access. To see your permissions, complete the following steps. 

* Log in to your account in the Contrast UI. 
* Select **Your Account** from the dropdown **user menu** beside your profile image. 
* Select the **Permissions** tab in the left navigation.

Your organization is listed at the top of the page along with your [organization role](admin-manageorgsroleperm.html). The **Application Permissions** grid communicates your role for each application within the organization. Click the help icon next to each role for details on the data access and actions made available by each level.
