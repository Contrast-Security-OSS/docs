In the next chart, get a glimpse of active applications. The inner ring designates the breakdown by language; choose the categories you want to compare in the outer ring by selecting **Technology** or **Grade** in the dropdown menu. 

Finally, view your deployed servers. Select **Container** or **Environment** in the dropdown menu to choose how the numbers are analyzed. 

To take a closer look at this information, select the **View** link under each heading. 

## Licenses

The Licenses tab features an activity trend chart of data on license consumption over the past year. Hover over a data point on the Assess or Protect trend lines to see how many licenses were used each month. The thermometer chart below shows the total number of licenses purchased compared to the number being used. The timeline shows how many licenses are about to expire on given dates. For a different view of the data, the circular charts show breakdowns by fraction and percentage for Assess and Protect. 

>**Note:** If your organization doesn't own any Protect or Assess licenses, Contrast alerts you to the count of unlicensed assets in that mode.

Hover over data points in the trend chart to see the number of Protect servers used and the number of available licenses that remained for each day. The y-axis marker (dotted line) shows the number of licenses that you had purchased. Use the dropdown menu above the chart to view data from a previous month within the past year.
