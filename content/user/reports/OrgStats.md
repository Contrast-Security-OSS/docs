Gain robust and comprehensive visibility into your organization data with Organization Statistics.


Go to the Reports page via the User Menu to find widgets with information about licensing utilization and expirations, breakdowns across various data points for onboarded applications, and deployed servers and how they’re being utilized. Use the filters in the dropdown menus to choose which data to compare at a glance.

In the Licenses chart, view the number of overall licenses for Assess and Protect, as well as the number of unlicensed applications and servers that exist in your organization. Click the application count to navigate to the Unlicensed quick view in the Applications page. 

In the next chart, get a glimpse of active applications. The inner ring designates the breakdown by language; choose the categories you want to compare in the outer ring by selecting **Technology** or **Grade** in the dropdown menu. 

Finally, view your deployed servers. Select **Container** or **Environment** in the dropdown menu to choose how the numbers are analyzed. 

To take a closer look at this information, select the **View** link under each heading. 

## Licenses

The Licenses tab features an Activity trend chart of data on license consumption over the past 12 months. Hover over a data point on the Assessment or Protection trend lines to see how many licenses were used that month. The thermometer chart below shows the total number of licenses purchased compared to the number being used. The timeline shows how many licenses are about to expire on given dates. For a different view of the data, take a look at the circular charts with breakdowns by fraction and percentage for Assessment and Protection. 

If your organization doesn't own any licenses for either Protection or Assessment, Contrast alerts you to the count of unlicensed assets in that mode.

## Applications

In the Applications tab, the Status thermometer chart shows the total number of applications broken down by the number that are licensed, unlicensed and archived. Click on the total number of onboarded applications to go to the Applications page for more details on each one. Contrast also reminds you of how many licenses are available in your organization. 

The circular Language Breakdown chart shows the number of applications by language in the inner band, and by Technology or Grade in the outer band. Click the number of active applications to go directly to the Applications page. High Risk, Monitored and Expirations snapshots show the number of applications with critical open vulnerabilities, no protection and expiring licenses, respectively. Applications that were added within the last week and applications that reside on an offline server are listed separately in the sidebar.

Switch to the Servers tab to view a thermometer chart that shows the breakdown of all deployed servers by environment. Click on the total number of servers to go to Servers page for more information on each one. 

The circular Container Breakdown chart displays the number of deployed servers for each language in a given environment. Select a different environment in the dropdown menu to update the ring and total number of servers. Click on the server count to go to the Servers page with the relevant environment filter applied. Snapshots show servers being Assessed and Protected as well as all servers online compared to the total number of servers in the given environment. The right sidebar includes a list of newly onboarded, offline and deleted servers.
