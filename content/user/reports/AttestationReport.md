Attestation reports provide evidence of vulnerability remediation based on the most current application information. Meet compliance and auditing requirements with each PDF report, which includes details about an applicationâ€™s custom and open source code vulnerabilities, as well as assessments against compliance and security standards.

## Report Content

Attestation reports include the following content:

* Itemized list of the specific filter settings used to generate the report
* Summary of the security posture for the application
* Vulnerabilities assessment for both custom code and open source libraries
* Route coverage, as a security assessment metric
* Optionally, a compliance policy assessment, and detailed information about open vulnerabilities for the application
* Appendix that describes methodologies and terminologies

## Generate a Report

Generate an asynchronous PDF report to see the status of an application.  

To create a report, go to the Applications grid and select an application. Click the **Reports** icon located at the top of the application's page. In the dropdown list, select **Generate Attestation Report**.

In the dialog that appears, define the **Vulnerabilities**, **Environments** and additional **Security Standards** that you want to include in the report.

### Filter options

Each report defaults to all vulnerabilities and environments, but you can filter them by clicking in the fields. Choose an option from Security Standards to include an additional **Security Standards** section in the generated report. Optionally, you can choose to include detailed information about open vulnerabilities.

The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report.


| Field                 | Default      | Filter Options                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vulnerabilities       | All          | Status (Reported, Suspicious, Confirmed, Not a Problem, Remediated, Fixed, Remediated - Auto-Verified) <br> Severity (Note, Low, Medium, High Critical) <br> Assess Rules |
| Vulnerability details | None         | Include vulnerability details       |
| Environments          | All          | Development <br> QA <br> Production |
| Security Standards    | None         |                                     |


Click **Generate**. Attestation reports generate asynchronously, and once generated, a download link appears in the **Notifications** panel.

## EOP Installation and Storage Configuration

A system administrator can configure reporting storage options by adding the following properties to the *general.properties* file: 
* **reporting.storage.mode**: Value options are `DB and` `FILE_SYS` (recommended)
* **reporting.storage.path**: Required when storage mode is set to `FILE_SYS`

The recommended setting for `reporting.storage.mode` is `FILE_SYS`. When `DB` is configured, the files are stored in the database, adding unnecessary contention on the database. 

With the `FILE_SYS` option, you must set up a file-sharing service where all Contrast nodes are able to access the file path. Provide this path as the value for `reporting.storage.path`.
