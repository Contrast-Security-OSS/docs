## How It Works 

Once you bring an application online, and it's reporting results, you may assign a license to the application. Without a license, vulnerability findings, application activity and a view of how the application is being used in real time aren't available. All applications in Contrast start with a temporary license by default. You can't transfer licenses between applications that are active or archived. To free a license from one application and assign it to another, you must reset and fully delete the licensed application. Once the application is deleted, the license returns to the organization pool. 

## Apply a License 

You must be an Organization Admin to assign a license to an individual application. Complete the following steps to enable a license from the **Applications** page or an application's **Overview** tab: 

* Identify the application to license in the Application page grid.
* In the dropdown menu, select **Apply License**. <br> You can also click the **Unlicensed** link beside the application name in the grid or the application's **Overview** tab, and then click the button to **Apply License** in the dialog that appears.

* The application is no longer marked as "Unlicensed", and all findings are visible.

Organization and Super Admins can also automatically apply licenses to new applications in the Organization Settings and System Settings pages, respectively. For more information about applying and managing licenses, read [Manage Licenses](admin-manageorgs.html#manage-license).
