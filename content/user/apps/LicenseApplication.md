## How It Works 

Once you bring an application online and it's reporting results, you can assign a license to the application. All applications in Contrast start with a temporary license by default. Without a license, you can't see vulnerability findings, application activity or visibility of how the application is being used in real time. You can't transfer licenses between applications that are active or archived. 

To free a license from one application and assign it to another, you must reset and fully delete the licensed application. Once the application is deleted, the license returns to the organization pool. 

## Apply a License 

You must be an OrgAdmin to assign a license to an individual application. To see unlicensed applications in your organization, look for the **Unlicensed** link beside the application name in the grid or the application's **Overview** page, or go to the **Unlicensed** quick view.

To apply a license, select the **Unlicensed** link beside the application name in the grid or the application's **Overview** page. In the dialog that appears, click the button to **Apply License**. Once completed, the application is no longer marked as "Unlicensed", and all findings are visible.

OrgAdmins and SuperAdmins can automatically apply licenses to new applications in the Organization Settings and System Settings pages, respectively. For more information about applying and managing licenses, read [Manage Licenses](admin-manageorgs.html#manage-license).
