Merging two or more applications into a single application is a common operation performed by Organization Administrators responsible for bringing applications online. The main purpose of merging is to present a single application view for the purposes of scoring, discovered vulnerabilities and remediation. Applications can be made up of components, which may show up individually in the application list. Merging also allows you to logically organize all of an application's components into one entity in Contrast.

## Create a Master Application 

To merge applications, go to the **Applications** grid, and use the check marks to select the applications to merge. Select the **Merge** icon from the menu at the bottom of the grid.

In the dialog that appears, use the dropdown menu to choose one of the merged applications to represent the **master application**. 

Once your applications are merged, you'll see a crown icon beside the name of the master application. To see the application modules represented by the master, click on the icon. To see all merged applications, go to the **Merged** quick view in the grid.

## Unmerge Applications

To unmerge either all or specific application modules from the master application, click on the crown icon in the application's grid row or **Overview** page. In the dialog that appears, select any number of the modules, and click the button to **Unmerge Selected** applications.
