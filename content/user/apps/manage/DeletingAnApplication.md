Deleting an application returns the application's enterprise license back into the license pool, making the license available for use by other applications. It also removes findings associated with the application, like vulnerabilities and libraries, that you no longer need or want.

## Step 1: Select an application

In the **Applications** page, click on the application you would like to delete. 

## Step 2: Stop reporting agents

From the application **Overview** page, verify that no servers are reporting to the application. If any servers are reporting, manually disable the servers in each environment by clicking the green **ON** button for Assess or Protect. In the dialog that appears, use the toggle to switch off the server, and click **Save**. Repeat this process for servers with Assess and/or Protect enabled in each environment, as needed.

If you don't disable all agents reporting on behalf of the application, leftover agents may continue to report findings, even after the application is deleted. As a result, the application would be recreated and continue to consume the license. 

## Step 3: Reset the application

It's best practice to reset the application to make sure that all associated vulnerabilities, URLs and components are cleared properly. Click the **Application Settings** (gear) icon in the top right of the application **Overview** page. At the bottom of the dialog that appears, select the link to **Reset Application**.

You can also reset from the **Applications** page by selecting one or more applications, and clicking the **Reset** batch action button.

## Step 4: Archive the application

Return to the **Application Defaults** dialog and select the link to **Archive Application**. Or, you can archive applications from the **Applications** page by selecting the appropriate applications in the grid, and clicking the **Archive** batch action button.

Once archived, applications don't appear in the **Applications** page grid by default. To view archived applications in the grid, check the **Show archived** filter in **Advanced Settings**. The applications then appears in the grid; however, you must restore them to view details beyond the grid. 

### Restore an application

You can restore (unarchive) an application by selecting it in the grid, and choosing **Unarchive** in the row menu.

You can also restore one or more applications from the **Applications** page by selecting the appropriate applications in the grid, and clicking the **Unarchive Applications** batch action button.

## Step 5: Delete the application

**When you delete an application, all of its associated findings - i.e., vulnerabilities and libraries - are removed permanently.** To complete the deletion process, close the **Advanced** filter panel, and select **Fully Delete** in the application's row menu. You can also select one or more archived applications in the grid, and click **Delete applications** in the batch action menu.

>**Note:** The application must be archived for this option to appear.
