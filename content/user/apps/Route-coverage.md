View the amount of coverage Contrast is providing to your application with route coverage. The more you exercise different URLs, or "routes", the more Contrast can successfully Assess and Protect your application. 

Go to the **Route Coverage** tab to view the routes that Contrast has identified in the application. Each layer of the line chart represents routes that have been **discovered** (but never exercised with Contrast), **exercised** with Contrast, and exercised but **vulnerable**. 

You can also view details of each route, including the number of vulnerabilities found, in the grid.
