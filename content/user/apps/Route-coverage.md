View the amount of coverage Contrast is providing to your application with route coverage. The more you exercise different URLs, or "routes", the more Contrast can successfully Assess and Protect your application. 

In application's **Overview** tab, view the number of routes exercised compared to the number of total routes in your application.

Click on the figure or navigate to the **Route Coverage** tab to view details for each route that Contrast has identified in the application. Each layer of the line chart represents routes that have been **discovered** by Contrast (but never exercised), **exercised** with Contrast, and exercised but **vulnerable**.

You can also view details of each route, including the number of vulnerabilities found, in the **Route** grid. Use the filters or the search field to find certain routes. 

<!-- If you suspect that there are more routes in your application that Contrast has yet to discover, click the **import** icon to upload a CSV spreadsheet of all known routes. -->
