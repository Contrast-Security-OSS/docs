The ability to compare differences across environments as code travels is a key piece of application security. Contrast provides constant visibility throughout the software development process from the moment code is written to when it’s pushed to production.

Go to the **Servers** page to set up environments. You can set the environment for each server to **Development**, **QA** or **Production**.

To see a side-by-side comparison of each environment for an application, select your application in the **Applications** page grid, and designate servers in the application **Overview** page. To designate new servers, click the links to **Set Up Servers** for each environment. <!-- In the **Servers** page... --> <!-- How? -->

Once setup is finished, Contrast can get busy finding weaknesses, and you can identify and compare the security risks associated to each environment.
