Contrast's flow map provides an interactive view of where data and resources are going from your applications. 

## How It Works

Contrast uses data reported from your Contrast agent to the UI to build a detailed view of where data from your application flows within your organization and beyond it. 

<!-- I'm assuming data is refreshed each time the agent reports to the UI. How often is this? -->
