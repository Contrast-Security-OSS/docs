As you might expect, Contrast's analysis *does* make your app run a little slower. The good news is that it's generally not enough for anyone to complain about, and the results are definitely worth it.

## Request Processing Time

It's probably more important to think about how Contrast affects the round-trip time.  In typical applications,  Contrast doubles the round-trip time for a request that contains a lot of business logic.  Contrast will only affect the CPU processing time of your application.  Round trip times for static resources typically don't get measurably worse.  In many applications much time is spent waiting on databases and accessing remote resources. In requests where the total round-trip time is dominated by database or WebService calls, Contrast's effect will be less noticeable.

If performance is really important to your environment, consider the following options:

* Run Contrast in *sampling* mode (enabled by default)
* Change sampling frequency to be less frequent
* Run Contrast during nightly integration tests
* Run Contrast in an alternate environment (QA system or DEV environment)
* Run Contrast on a single node in a load balanced environment
* Change the stack trace configuration of Contrast to Limited or Minimal
