<!-- ## License Libraries 
How do you provision licenses if you've paid for them? Like normal licenses in Org Settings? -->

## View Library Licenses

License data is available for your open source libraries in the **Libraries** grid. To view an individual library's license, hover over the library name in the grid. License information is also displayed in the header of a library's **Details** page, which is accessed by clicking on the library name.  Note that licenses are listed in SPDX format.

To find libraries with specific licenses, use the filter for the grid. Select the **Advanced** link above the grid, and expand the **Libraries** section to see a list of all of the library licenses used in your organization. 

Open Source license display is available to OSS customers only. Contact your Organization Admin to enable OSS.

### Export

License details for each library are also included in any CSV or XML files exported from the Contrast UI. To read how to export library data, see [Manage Libraries](user-libraries.html#manage-lib).
