<!-- ## License Libraries 
How do you provision licenses if you've paid for them? Like normal licenses in Org Settings? -->

## View Library Licenses

To view license info for your libraries, go to the **Libraries** grid. To see the license for a specific application, hover over the library name in the grid; or select the library from the grid and view the license in the header of the **Details** page.

To find libraries with specific licenses, use the filter for the grid. Select the **Advanced** link above the grid, and expand the **Libraries** section to see a list of all of the library licenses used in your organization. 

 
### Export

License details for each library are also included in any CSV or XML files exported from the Contrast UI. To read how to export library data, see [Manage Libraries](user-libraries.html#manage-lib).
