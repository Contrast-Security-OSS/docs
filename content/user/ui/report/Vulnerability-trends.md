Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Use the Vulnerbility Trend reports to recognize the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they're being managed so that you have a better understanding of your security posture.

## Access Data
 
Select **Reports** in the User menu to go the Vulnerability Trend dashboard. Click the **View** link to see the graphs in more detail. 

Select **New** to see a graph of new vulnerabilities. Select **Total** to see a graph of all reported vulnerabilities compared to all remediated vulnerabilities. Each black data point in the graph generates a tooltip with the number of Suspicious, Confirmed and Reported vulnerabilities on that date when you hover over it. Each green data point generates a tooltip with the number of Not A Problem, Remediated and Fixed vulerabilities on that date.

###Filter vulnerabilities

Each report defaults to all applications, servers and rules, but you can filter vulnerabilities by clicking in the fields above the graph. The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report. 


| Field        | Default      | Filter Options                                                                                              |

## Save Reports

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the User level, so each of you have your own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. You can edit or delete these reports at any time.

To save a report view, click the star icon at the top right of the report page. This generates a popup with a field to name the report. Once saved, the named report appears next to the **Vulnerability Trend** heading with a dropdown menu. Each time you come to the Vulnerability Trend page, the menu shows all of your saved reports as well as an option to **Start a new report**.

### Rename reports

When viewing a saved report, hover over the star icon to generate a **Manage Report** tooltip. Click the icon to produce a popup with a field to rename the report and buttons to **Cancel**, **Remove** or **Save**. 

### Edit and remove reports

If you change filter options while viewing a saved report, the star icon changes to an unsaved state and **Edited** appears next to the report name. Click the icon to generate a popup menu to **Save Existing** or **Save As New**. Choose **Save Existing** to update the saved report name with the current filters and remove the **Edited** status. Choose **Save As New** to save the report view with the current filters as a new report under a different name.

Click **Remove** to permanently delete the saved report that you're currently viewing. Contrast automatically takes you to the default Vulnerability Trend page view and removes the report name from the dropdown menu. 

### Start new reports

To clear unsaved edits to an existing report and start over with the report defaults, choose the **Start a new report** option in the dropdown menu. The report name changes to **New Report**.

### Manage reports 

When you've created more than five saved reports, a **Manage** link appears within the Saved Reports dropdown. Click the link to go to the **Manage Saved Reports** dialog. Select the checkbox next to each report that you want to remove or use the **Select All** checkbox. To rename a report in the dialog, click the report name and edit it inline. You can also use the search field to find reports.

## Export Reports

Create a timestamped PDF report of the Vulnerability Trend to capture a snapshot of your vulnerability management by clicking the **Export** icon in the upper right hand corner of the page. Contrast immediately generates the report and prompts you to download when it’s ready. Each PDF report includes a summary of the variables included in your customized view, the trend graphic, and a table of the metrics and breakdowns of each data point.
