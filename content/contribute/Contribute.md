To submit edits of existing content, click the **Edit icon** next to the article title.  This will bring you to the source within the GitHub repo.  Click the Edit icon again (top right) to make changes.  At the bottom of the page, provide a brief description of your revisions and select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** before selecting **Commit changes**. Name the branch according to its topic and Contrast will review your submission. For more information on pull requests, check out [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).


### Submitting New Content

OpenDocs support documentation is comprised of markdown files. Should you want to write and submit new content, we'd like to receive it in markdown format.  This [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) can get you started.
