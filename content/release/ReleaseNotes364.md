## Improvements

Use Server Messages to stay on top of agent updates. When your agent version is out of date, Contrast will send you an email with recommendations for updates. You can also check your notifications in the Contrast UI, or hover over the warning icon in the **Servers** grid and your server's **Overview** tab for a reminder. To enable Server Messages, go to the **Notifications** page from **Your Account** or **Organization Settings**.

### Node.js summary 


### Ruby summary 

The Ruby team has been focused on expanding our feature offering for this release. We expanded our rule coverage to include support for several new Assess rules, with a focus on rules responsible for HTTP Session security evaluation. To improve our customer support, we also added the ability to generate heap dumps directly from the agent. Finally, in continuing with our effort to improve our interoperability with other testing infrastructures, we've continued to transition our sensor weaving into *C*, and we've addressed bugs causing an incompatibility with the FactoryBot testing framework.
