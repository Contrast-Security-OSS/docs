## Sneak Peak

### Java agent updates

As of version 3.5.8 of Contrast, the auto-updating version of the Java agent is no longer available for download. The auto-update feature is not compatible with Contrast's design changes made to support the Java Platform Module System included in Java beginning with version 9. Existing agents with the auto-update feature will continue to function; however, once Contrast releases an agent capable of supporting Java 9+, they will no longer update to the latest version. 

For more information on how to keep your agents up to date, see <!-- the section on Upgrading(link-to-docs) on the Java Agent installation page. -->
