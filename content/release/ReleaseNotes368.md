## Bug Fixes

* When impersonating an admin-level user in multiple organizations, the UI showed dashboard information and agent connection details for the admin's default organization. CONTRAST-37676, CONTRAST-36028
* Filters didn't load correctly for the **Servers** grid. CONTRAST-36013
* The form to configure output to of Protect events to syslog didn't accept some IP address formats. CONTRAST-38275

## New and Improved Features

* Use the application [flow map](user-apps.html#flowmap)...

* Use Contrast's new [PagerDuty integration](admin-orgintegrations.html#pagerduty) to receive attack notifications outside of the UI. Each notification automatically provides details on the attack, including the application, server and source IP involved. Go to the **user menu > Organization Settings > Integrations tab** to connect your PagerDuty account to your Contrast organization.
