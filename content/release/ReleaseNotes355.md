Just in: ...! 

## Fixes

* Merge applications from the new Applications grid. CONTRAST-24968
* Create new organizations with an email address from an existing Contrast account. CONTRAST-25937
* Last reported date for vulnerabilities will display more accurately. CONTRAST-21720
* Application grid displays correctly for Safari users. CONTRAST-22613
* 


## Improvements

* Track and verify the extent of security assessment for each of your applications in the [Route Coverage](user-apps.html#route) tab. Contrast breaks down the data for exercised versus unexercised routes, where Contrast has detected traffic versus where we havenâ€™t, as well as the specific routes that house vulnerabilities. Route coverage is now available for the major frameworks, including Java Spring MVC 4.x, .NET MVC 4 and 5, Node Express, Ruby Rails and Python Django.

* Set global vulnerability threshold conditions in the [Contrast Jenkins plugin](tools-ci.html#jenkins). Teams may then override the conditions for specific jobs.

* Only OrgAdmin-level users and above can see empty servers in the Contrast UI. (Servers that have applications will be visible as they are today and honor all the usual [access rules](admin-manageorgs.html#access).)

* We've changed the keys around a bit so you can find them all in one place. Go to the **Organization Settings > Profile page** to see your Organization ID, API key, and Agent Service key. You can also find your personal keys in the **Profile > Your Account tab**.
