Dig deeper into your applications with route coverage and...! 

## Fixes

* Create a new organization with the email address of an existing Contrast account. CONTRAST-25937
* The last-reported date for vulnerabilities will display more accurately. CONTRAST-21720
* The **Applications** grid displays correctly for Safari users. CONTRAST-22613
* Applications that don't have Assess enabled won't be counted in the overall score for your organization. CONTRAST-25806
* Contrast will test your Jira configuration with the latest credential set selected. CONTRAST-25760
* Advanced filters will work together to show you the right results in the **Servers** grid. CONTRAST-25953


## Improvements

* Keep track of your entire application, piece by piece, in the [Route Coverage](user-apps.html#route) tab. Contrast breaks down the data for exercised versus unexercised routes, where Contrast has detected traffic versus where we havenâ€™t, as well as the specific routes that house vulnerabilities. Route coverage is now available for the major frameworks, including Java Spring MVC 4.x, .NET MVC 4 and 5, Node Express, Ruby Rails and Python Django.

* Set global vulnerability threshold conditions in the [Contrast Jenkins plugin](tools-ci.html#jenkins). Teams may then override the conditions for specific jobs.

* Only OrgAdmin-level users and above can see empty servers in the Contrast UI. (Servers that have applications will be visible as they are today and honor all the usual [access rules](admin-manageorgs.html#access).)

* We've moved the keys around a bit to make them easier to find. Go to the **user menu > Organization Settings > Profile page** to see your [Organization ID](admin-orgsettings.html#apikey), API key, and Agent Service key; or, go to the **Profile > Your Account tab** to find your [personal keys](user-account.html#profile).
