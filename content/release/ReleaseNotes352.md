## Fixes

* Sort attack events in the grid CONTRAST-22807
* Sort Assess Rules by severity in an application's Policy page, and see accurate results. CONTRAST-22538
* Navigate to affected applications from attack **Notes** page. CONTRAST-22808

## Improvements 

* Use the new version of the [Contrast Maven Plugin](tools-build.html#maven)! There’s no need to manually configure JVM arguments, and the plugin is now automatically integrated with TravisCI and CircleCI build numbers.

* Our new applications grid is in Beta! We’ve given you more direct access to filters while retaining them as you work, provided more insight to your vulnerabilities, and cleaned up the UI for more simplicity. Go to the **Applications** page to give it a try, and then let us know what you think!
