New reporting on your organization and the ability to save custom views of the Vulnerability Trend report make this release a must-see. We also made rule management a little bit easier, and even snuck in fixes to some annoying bugs. Right on!

## Fixes

* Resolved a couple of bugtracker errors so you don’t run into issues when sending vulnerabilities.
* Fixed page errors when activating a user account. 
* Fixed the search field in an application's Activity tab.
* Addressed a few minor access control bugs. Whew!
* Stopped the Agent from flagging Probed events from IPs on Trusted Hosts lists.
* Now able to run POPULATE-LIBRARY-CACHE with Ruby Artifacts. Yay!
* No more NPEs! Create users, process vulnerabilities, use library endpoints, configure bugtrackers and read attack details with no hassle. 
* Fixed Migration 3.3.9.018 from failing on fresh installations.
