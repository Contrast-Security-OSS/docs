## Contrast for .NET Details:
### What is Contrast™.NET?
Contrast .NET enables the Contrast Application Security platform to analyze Microsoft .NET web applications for dozens of common and dangerous vulnerabilities.  It continuously verifies the security of Microsoft .NET applications in development, testing, and operations, including those run on the Microsoft Azure cloud service.  As an agent extension to the existing Contrast SaaS and software platform, there is nothing new for customers to buy or learn, NET applications are automatically discovered through a simple agent installer, and results are presented in the existing Contrast Team Server console.  

Contrast for .NET has the following additional features and benefits:
* Same “Team Server” user experience.  For problem identification, there is virtually nothing new to learn
* A fast and familiar and easy zero-configuration installer
* Support for .NET 2.0 and later that enables retroactive support legacy apps dating back to 2005.
* Support for Microsoft C#, Visual Basic and ASP.NET.  Unofficial support for many more CLR compiled languages
* .NET context sensitive remediation guidance
* Support for Microsoft Azure virtual machine deployments
