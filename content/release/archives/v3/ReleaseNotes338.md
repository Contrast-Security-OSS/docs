There are three important things to call out for the 3.3.8 release of the .NET Agent:
  1. **Windows Server 2008 R2 Patch Requirement**: The .NET Agent now requires that operating system has specific security patch that adds support for SHA-2 based code signing (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46148). The .NET Agent's Monitor-based instrumentation components are code signed using SHA-2 and therefore the agent now requires this capability. 
  2. **Versioning Change**: The next release of the .NET Agent will move to a new versioning scheme to address some limitations of installer technology. The agent currently uses four version numbers (e.g. 1.2.3.4) and will be moving to three version numbers (e.g. 1.2.3). The next release of the .NET Agent will be version 4.0.0.
  3. **CLR2 Assess Support**: The next release of the .NET Agent will change the default instrumentation engine to Monitor (rather the Profiler.) Any CLR2 applications will, by default, not be analyzed by Assess rules in the next release. Note that Protect rules currently only support CLR4 applications.
