## Improvements

* Redesigned and enhanced grids for applications, servers, and vulnerabilities make the most important data easier to find and streamline your daily tasks. Improvements include, but are certainly not limited to, filters per column, enhanced search functions, instantly visible tags and easier access to row actions. If you have questions or suggestions for more improvements, use the **Give Us Feedback** button above any of the grids.

* Assign key:value pairs to applications during onboarding for better organization and tracking. Go to **Organization Settings > Applications** to define [custom fields](admin-orgsettings.html#app-defaults) - such as such as Application ID, Business Unit and Point of Contact - for new and existing applications. Contrast even provides a preformatted configuration property to copy and use in your own files. 

* Configure your [VSTS integration](admin-orgintegrations.html#vsts-tfs) to send tickets to a specific backlog for a subproject.
