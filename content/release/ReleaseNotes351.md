## Fixes

* 

## Improvements 

* Our Jenkins plugin has been enhanced with a few new features! Use the plugin with a proxy, or use a new flag to disregard Contrast findings for a specific Jenkins job. You can even try Results Only mode - Contrast will set the job status of a build to a customized status, like as Not Build, Aborted or Unstable.

* If you like our Slack integration, you’ll like it even better with more granular information about your vulnerabilities. New details include server, application and rule names as well as time of detection. (You can set up the integration from the Integrations tab in Organization Settings.)

* Good integrations make it even easier to send Contrast findings into your developers’ backlogs. In the tradition of JIRA, VSTS/TFS and Bugzilla support, we present to you GitHub issues - yet another way to send those vulnerabilities out of Contrast (and your applications)!
