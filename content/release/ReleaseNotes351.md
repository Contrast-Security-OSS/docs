Improved integrations and enhanced plugin features...

## Fixes

* Erroneous info has been removed from your Audit Log. CONTRAST-22183
* Send vulnerabilities to your bugtracker, even for Note severity. CONTRAST-21914, CONTRAST-22066
* No more Organization Settings for View users. CONTRAST-22272
* Save changes to fields in JIRA integration. CONTRAST-22063
* Edits to your HipChat integration show up in the room immediately. CONTRAST-21323
* EOP customers can complete login tests for LDAP authentication. CONTRAST-22486

## Improvements 

* Our Jenkins plugin has been enhanced with a few new features! Use the plugin with a proxy, or use a new flag to disregard Contrast findings for a specific Jenkins job. You can even try Results Only mode - Contrast will set the job status of a build to a customized status, like as Not Build, Aborted or Unstable.

* Good integrations make it even easier to send Contrast findings into your developers’ backlogs. In the tradition of JIRA, VSTS/TFS and Bugzilla support, we present to you GitHub issues - yet another way to send those vulnerabilities out of Contrast (and your applications)!

* If you like our Slack integration, you’ll like it even better with more granular information about your vulnerabilities. New details include server, application and rule names as well as time of detection. (You can set up the integration from the Integrations tab in Organization Settings.)
