Improved integrations and enhanced Jenkins plugin features...

## Fixes

* Erroneous info has been removed from your Audit Log. CONTRAST-22183
* Send vulnerabilities to your bugtracker, even for Note severity. CONTRAST-21914, CONTRAST-22066
* No more Organization Settings for View users. CONTRAST-22272
* Save changes to fields in JIRA integration. CONTRAST-22063
* Edits to your HipChat integration show up in the room immediately. CONTRAST-21323
* EOP customers can complete login tests for LDAP authentication. CONTRAST-22486

## Improvements 

* Use our Jenkins plugin with a proxy or try a new flag to disregard Contrast findings for a specific Jenkins job. You can even try Results Only mode: Contrast will set the job status of a build to a customized status, like as "Not Build", "Aborted" or "Unstable".

* In the tradition of JIRA, VSTS/TFS and Bugzilla support, we present to you GitHub issues - yet another way to send those vulnerabilities out of Contrast (and your applications)!

* Get ready for even more vulnerability details with Slack! New info includes server, application and rule names as well as time of detection.
