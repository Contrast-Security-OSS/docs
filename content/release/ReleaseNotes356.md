Lots of words...

## Fixes

* Complete actions in the Servers grid row, even if you're using EI11. 
* Delete a server without errors, even if you just deleted the application. CONTRAST-27209
* Protect will show as "on" for merged and child applications on Protect-enabled servers. CONTRAST-23185


## Improvements

* Send vulnerabilities to [Agile Central](admin-orgintegrations.html#central) (FKA Rally) with our one-way integration that lets you set fields like Project Name, Defect State, Environment, Priority and more. 

* Common config? 

* We changed the default filtering in the Applications grid to show you only licensed applications. Of course, you can still filter by your other favorite categories to make your search even easier.
