## Fixes

* Filter Attacks by IP address to find the right ones in the grid. CONTRAST-23199
* Attack details honor permissions for the application involved. CONTRAST-21174
* See only the right vulnerabilities in your server's Overview. CONTRAST-24756
* Non-internet connected EOP users can see the complete list of their libraries. CONTRAST-23907
* Add an application to multiple access groups during onboarding. CONTRAST-19983
* Successfully sort Assess Rule by severity. (And then appreciate the alliteration.) CONTRAST-21640
* No Security Controls for invalid targets, like primitives. CONTRAST-21981
* Contrast saves your auto-licensing configuration. CONTRAST-21901
* Use the Build Number and Untracked filters for vulnerabilities, just as expected. CONTRAST-17857, CONTRAST-24137

## Improvements

* Find out whatâ€™s happening in each route of your application with the new Route Coverage page, where you can see details like where Contrast saw traffic on certain days or found vulnerabilities. Coverage is available currently for .NET MVC and Node Express. 

* Contrast stores the credentials you entered in your last Jira configuration, and automatically applies them when you set up the next one. You can also manage your credentials by adding news ones or editing an existing set.

* EOP customers can set proxy settings and rest assured that all integration traffic will flow through it.
