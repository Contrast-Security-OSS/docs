## Agent Updates

### Java Agent Summary

The Java team worked to **improve accuracy in Assess** for this release in these areas:

* Detecting XSS attacks on Java Servlet applications

* Detecting SSRF attacks

* When using Java 11

The team also made **improvements for reporting and troubleshooting,** as well as smaller bug fixes. These include:

* Clarified usage of the *max_stack_depth* property and improved reporting of the error that occurs when it is misconfigured.

* Added a heartbeat message to help administrators diagnose Contrast Protect syslog connectivity.

### .NET agent summaries

The team **improved sensitive data masking** for cookies and assured **higher accuracy for Path Traversal rules** in Protect. 

#### .NET Framework 

The team **improved route-based coverage** across the board to more accurately discover and observe routes for different routing configurations. They also fixed the following bugs:

* Error logging bug when the agent had a problem discovering applications hosted on IIS

* The agent could produce an invalid IL code for applications that were re-deployed dozens and dozens of times without a server restart.

#### .NET Core

The Contrast .NET Core agent now supports Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE)! See https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-netcoresupport.html 

The team also added a feature to capture and report the HTTP POST body for vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Node.js summary 

The Node team is pleased to announce **full support for NodeJS** version 12 LTS.

The team also implemented **route-based auto-verification** (RBAV) functionality for the agent. RBAV will be fully released and functional when our main products also complete server implementation for route-based auto-verification.

We fixed how Assess reports relevant findings from malicious cookies for the Koa framework.

### Ruby summary 

The Ruby team focused on **language compatibility** to ensure the agent adheres to best practices and works alongside common dependencies. In particular, the team addressed an incompatibility with FactoryBot, allowing the agent to run with the gem installed. The team also fixed an incompatibility with the 2.6 base image on Heroku, so the agent can once again be installed in that environment.

In addition, updates to Contrast Service runner assure startup in all supported installations, as well as improved interoperability for applications running in multiple processes.

The team also implemented route-based auto-verification (RBAV), slated for full release later this year.

### Python summary

The Python team released the Python Assess beta and continues to add features and stability improvements. 

The team also improved the agentâ€™s SQLAlchemy support and request body handling. The agent now logs its configuration and log file locations to stdout on initialization. The team fixed several issues surrounding its communication with the Contrast Service, enabling the agent to use the latest version of the Service (2.3.0) by default.

Additional improvements include PyCassa support for SQL injection and updates to internal testing and packaging.
