You can ask Contrast to log verbose information by passing a custom system property, ```-Dcontrast.log=/path/to/log.txt -Dcontrast.level=DEBUG -Dcontrast.log.daily=true``` to the server process.

These JVM options will put Contrast into debug mode and log all output to the log file specified as the system property value. It will also prevent the log from rolling over into multiple files. The log file will start with some messages that look similar to this:

<a href="assets/images/KB1-d11.png" rel="lightbox" title="Log File"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB1-d11.png"/></a>

These verbose logs will allow our support team to diagnose any issues you may encounter.  Please submit diagnostic logs when [filing a bug report](mailto:bugs@contrastsecurity.com).
