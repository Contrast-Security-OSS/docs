## Issue 

You might run into an issue connecting to your identity provider, if you're using a metadata URL with an HTTPS certificate from an unsupported authority, such as a self-signed certificate. 

## Solution

To resolve the issue, [configure SSO](installation-setupauth.html#sso-setup) by unchecking **I have access to the metadata URL** and pasting the metadata XML for the IDP into the text box.
