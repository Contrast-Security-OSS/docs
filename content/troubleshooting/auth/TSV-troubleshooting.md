## Backup Methods

If you've implemented [two-step verification](admin-orgsecurity.html#security-tsv), but haven't successfully received a verification code through the method you chose, you can click the **Can't Sign In?** link in Step Two of the login process. Contrast will then email a temporary code to you, which is valid for five minutes. You can also use a backup code. 

If email is already the chosen notification method, contact your Administrator to investigate potential issues with email settings.

## Reset Your Device

If you're having issues with Google Authenticator, you manually reset your device by clicking the **Reset Device** link in User Settings. This clears all data for the current device and requires resetting Google Authenticator on the same or a new device.
