In rare scenarios, bad instrumentation causes a web server process to crash or a specific page to error out. If you ever encounter a crash or error caused by Contrast, please report the error and [file a bug report](mailto:bugs@contrastsecurity.com). If possible, follow the steps below to gather agent logs and process dumps; this additional information is vital to reproducing and fixing these types of bugs. 

## Agent Logs Directory

The Contrast .NET agent logs information to the *Contrast\dotnet\LOGS* directory within *C:\ProgramData\Contrast\dotnet\LOGS*, the Windows 2008/2012 *ProgramData* directory. Depending on the setup of the Windows profile and folder view settings, the directories may be hidden. If so, paste the paths into the Windows Explorer location; you may need to replace the drive letter *C* with *D*.

You can change which information is logged by changing the logging level in the [.NET agent configuration](installation-netconfig.html).

## Types of Bugs

There are two primary types of agent bugs for which Contrast needs to gather logs and other information:    

* Process Crash
* Unhandled Managed Exception/Page Error/500

## Process Crash Bugs

### Verify that the web server process crashed 

Check your scenario against the following indicators to confirm that the web server process crashed. 

* The web application is unresponsive after installing the Contrast .NET agent.

* The Windows Event Log (**Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application**) has Error entries for the ".NET Runtime" and "Application Error". 

 * The ".NET Runtime" error has details such as: 

  ```
   Application: w3wp.exe
   Framework Version: v4.0.30319
   Description: The process was terminated due to an internal error in the .NET Runtime at IP XXXXXXXXX with exit code YYYYYYY
  ```

 * The "Application Error" entry has details similar to:

   ```
    Faulting application name: w3wp.exe, version: 8.5.9600.16384, time stamp: 0x5215df96
    Faulting module name: clr.dll, version: 4.7.2114.0, time stamp: 0x59a63e48
    Exception code: 0xc0000005
    Fault offset: 0x00000000002ff61c
    Faulting process id: 0x3724
    Faulting application start time: 0x01d337d711f21e68
    Faulting application path: c:\windows\system32\inetsrv\w3wp.exe
    Faulting module path: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\clr.dll
    Report Id: 4fc99650-a3ca-11e7-80e8-005056bd4248
   ```

Once you confirm that the observed bug is a process crash, you're ready to gather information to file a bug. 

### Gather information on the process crash 

Complete the following steps to gather information to send to Contrast. 

* Set up the ProcDump utility to capture crash dump. 
  * Download current version of ProcDump from the [Microsoft documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) to the Windows server with the agent.
  * From an administrator command prompt: 
    ```
     md c:\dumps 
     procdump.exe -ma -i c:\dumps
    ```
  * Install the latest Contrast .NET agent.
  * [Stop the .NET agent service](http://127.0.0.1:9000/installation-netusage.html#usage).
  * Enable additional logging. 
     * ** Start > Notepad > Right click > Run as Administrator**
     * ** File > Open >** *C:\Program Files\Contrast\dotnet\DotnetAgentService.exe.config*
     * Change `ShouldLogMethodSignatures` to `true`.
     * Uncomment the entry for `LogLevel`. 
     * Check that the specified `LogLevel` value is `trace`.
  * Start the .NET agent service.
  * Exercise the application to reproduce the crash.

Once you've reproduced the crash, gather the following items and include them in your bug report:

* Agent Logs: All files in the agent log directory, *C:\ProgramData\Contrast\dotnet\LOGS*; right click on the **LOGS folder > Send To > Compressed (zip) folder**.
* Windows Event Log: **Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application > Save All Events As > "MyEvents.evtx"**
* Crash Dumps: Create a zip file of each w3wp process dump file in *C:\dumps* (e.g., *w3wp.exe_171002_151601.dmp*). Dump files can be quite large.

You can then uninstall ProcDump with `C:>procdump.exe -u`. 

## Unhandled Managed Exception or Page Error Bugs 

### Verify an unhandled exception

The above process also helps the .NET engineering team resolve issues such as application errors caused by the Contrast .NET agent. Use the following indicators to determine if the Contrast .NET agent is causing an application error. 

* You've observed the application working normally without the agent. 

* You've observed a page of the application "crashing" (returning a 500 error) under the agent. 

* There are no errors for ."NET Runtime" and "Application Error" in the Windows Event Log.

* There **may be warnings** for "ASP.NET" in the Windows Event Log. The warning should look similar to the following:

   ```

   ```

As the process hasn't crashed, ProcDump won't capture process dumps. Instead, you must gather the process dump manually by completing the following steps. 

* Find the Process ID of the worker process that you need. 
  * IIS Manager > Worker Processes: Find the "Application Pool Name" you need, and take note of the value in the "Process Id". 

* From an administrator command prompt, replace `NNNNN` with the process ID from the previous step.

  ```
  C:\>procdump -ma NNNNN
  ```

Follow a similar process to gather agent logs, windows events and process dumps to include with your bug report. 

## Other Bugs

If you encountered a bug other than a process crash or unhandled exception - maybe the .NET Tray has an inaccurate state, or the agent found a false positive - please [file a bug report](mailto:bugs@contrastsecurity.com). Contrast doesn't usually need process dumps, but trace-level logs and a detailed description of the problem are very helpful when it's time to fix these bugs.
