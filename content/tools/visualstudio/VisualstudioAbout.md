## Use Contrast for Visual Studio

Contrast provides visibility to vulnerabilities in your applications and protects them against attacks. 
For applications deployed with the Contrast agent, access vulnerability information directly within 
your Visual Studio IDE. You're directed to the line of code inside Visual Studio and can view more details in 
the Contrast console, allowing you to provide application security feedback to developers right at 
the time of development for faster remediation.
