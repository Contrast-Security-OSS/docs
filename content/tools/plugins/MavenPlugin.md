## About the Plugin

The Contrast Maven Plugin is used to integrate the Contrast *jar* with your build. It's capable of authenticating a user to Contrast, downloading the latest Java agent and verifying your build.

> **Note:** [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a build tool that utilizes *pom.xml* files to configure your applications. It's used to build, package and test Java applications.

This guidance refers to version 2.0 of the Contrast Maven Plugin. For information on version 1.X, refer to the documentation in Contrast's [Github repository](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-maven-plugin/blob/contrast-maven-plugin-1.4/README.md).

## Access the Plugin

You can view the plugin code in Contrast's [Github repository](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-maven-plugin). You can also review how our two goals, `install` and `verify`, work.

## Use the Plugin

Use the Maven plugin to allow Contrast to discover vulnerabilities in your application during integration or verification tests. 

### Goals

* `install`: Installs a Contrast Java agent to your local project.
* `verify`: Checks for new vulnerabilities in your web application.

## Configuration

The table below shows all the parameters for the plugin. These settings are for connecting to Contrast and filtering your vulnerabilities.

| Parameter   | Required | Default    | Description                                                                       | Since |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| username    | True     |            | Username in the Contrast application                                              |       |
| serviceKey  | True     |            | [Service Key](admin-orgsettings.html#apikey)                                      |       |
| apiKey      | True     |            | [API Key](admin-orgsettings.html#apikey)                                          |       |
| orgUuid     | True     |            | [Organization UUID](admin-orgsettings.html#apikey)                                |       |
| appName     | True     |            | Name of the application as seen in the Contrast UI                                |       |
| appId       | False    |            | ID of the application as seen in the Contrast UI. Either the `appId` or `appName` is required. If both are specified, Contrast uses the `appId` and ignores the `appName`. | 2.5 |
| standalone  | False    | False      | Set this to "true" if this is a standalone application.                           |    2.2|
| appVersion  | False    |             | The `appversion` to report to the Contrast application. See the **appVersion** section for more information.    |       |
| apiUrl      | True     |            | API URL to your Contrast application                                              |       |
| serverName  | True     |            | Name of the server you set with `-Dcontrast.server`                               |       |
| serverId    | False    |            | ID of the server as seen in the Contrast UI. Either the `serverId` or `serverName` is required. If both are specified, Contrast uses the `serverId` and ignores the `serverName`. | 2.5 |
| serverPath  | False    |            | The server context path                                                           |    2.1|
| minSeverity | False    | Medium     | Minimum severity level to verify; options are Note, Low, Medium, High or Critical |       |
| jarPath     | False    |            | Path to *contrast.jar*, if you already have one downloaded                        |       |
| skipArgLine | False    | False      | If this is "true", the plugin will not alter the Maven `argLine` property in any way. |    2.0 |

>**Note**: Even if your build succeeds, the plugin will fail the overall build if a vulnerability with adequate severity is found.

## Option Details

### JVM arguments

The Contrast Maven Plugin will configure your JVM arguments to use the Contrast agent by appending to the `argLine` property from the Maven properties. If you want to prevent this in order to build your own JVM arguments, set `skipArgLine` to `true` in the plugin properties.

### serverPath

Multi-module Maven builds can appear as different servers in Contrast. If you want to discourage this behavior, and prefer to see all modules appear under the same server in Contrast, set the `serverPath` property.

**You are strongly encouraged to add a `serverPath`, if this build will be run in a continuous integration (CI) environment such as Travis CI or Circle CI.** This will help you keep your servers tidy in the Contrast UI. 

### appVersion

When your application's integration tests are run, the Contrast agent can add an `appVersion` property to its metadata. This allows you to compare vulnerabilities between applications versions, CI builds, etc. Contrast generates the `appVersion` in the following order:

* If you specify an `appVersion` in the properties, Contrast will use it without modification.
* If your build is running in TravisCI, Contrast will use `appName-$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER`.
* If your build is running in CircleCI, Contrast will use `appName-$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`.
* If you don't specify an `appVersion`, Contrast will generate one in `appName-yyyyMMddHHmmss` format. 

## Containers

See the following articles for specific installation instructions:

* [Install the agent on Maven Apache Tomcat](installation-javaserver.html#apache)
