The Contrast Software Development Kit (SDK) provides access to tools and libraries that help a developer either build a product for a specific platform, or include specific components within their product. There is currently an SDK for **Java** and **Python**.

We built the SDK to make it easier to interact with a TeamServer instance by providing classes and methods for any application. The SDK does this by wrapping direct TeamServer API calls and de-serializing JSON responses into Java objects.

**To get started with the SDK, you’ll need:**
* JDK 7 or 8
* Maven
* A TeamServer account

Once those prerequisites are met, you will need to clone the SDK repository, which is available from GitHub. The Java SDK can also be used in a Maven or Gradle-based project via the [Maven Central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22contrast-sdk-java%22).
