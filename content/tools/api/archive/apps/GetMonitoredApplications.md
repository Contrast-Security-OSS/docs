## The "/s/api/app/list" Service

You can get a list of the applications registered for your organization, as well as their IDs with this service. It takes no arguments. This is the first step to a lot of API calls, because it's the only way to get an application's ID.

>**Note:** The authorization header value is not prefixed with **Basic** or **Digest** or other values
