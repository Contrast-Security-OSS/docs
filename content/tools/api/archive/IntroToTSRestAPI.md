Contrast offers a HATEOS-compliant **REST API** that allows you to collect nearly all of the same information that is accessible in your web account. You can get vulnerability information, coverage data, download agents, and more through the API. Our goal is to make sure Contrast offers data to allow complete integration into your existing Continuous Integration (CI), SIEM software, or other business intelligence dashboards.

We're always adding more endpoints, but if you'd like to see something added to the API, [file a ticket](https://support.contrastsecurity.com/tickets/new) and let's talk about it!
