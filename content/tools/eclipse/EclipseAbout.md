## Use Contrast for Eclipse

Contrast provides visibility to vulnerabilities in your applications and protects them against attacks. For applications deployed with the Contrast agent, access vulnerability information directly within your Eclipse IDE. You're directed to the line of code inside Eclipse and can view more details in the Contrast console, allowing you to provide application security feedback to developers right at the time of development for faster remediation.
