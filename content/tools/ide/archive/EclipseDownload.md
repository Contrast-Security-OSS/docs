## Drag and Drop (Option 1)

The Contrast for Eclipse plugin can be found in the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/contrast-eclipse) by searching **Contrast for Eclipse**, or can be downloaded directly by dragging the preceding link into an active Eclipse workspace.
Once installed, you will have to restart Eclipse for the plugin to be loaded. You can then open the Contrast view (***Window > Show View > Other > Contrast Security > Contrast***) or start a server with Contrast (***Servers > Right click on your server > Start with Contrast***).

## Install New Software (Option 2)
* In Eclipse, open the **Help** menu and select **Install New Software**
* Click **Add** and add the URL "https://eclipse.contrastsecurity.com/repository" to your repositories

* Select the **Contrast Security** software and click **Next**
* Click **Next** and the accept the license agreement
* Click **Finish** and the plugin should begin to install
 * You may be prompted to install unsigned content. This is normal. In order to support older but not end of lifed versions of Eclipse, we are unable to sign the jar file
* When prompted, restart Eclipse to complete the install.
* If the view does not automatically open, you can find it under ***Window > Show View > Other > Contrast for Eclipse***
