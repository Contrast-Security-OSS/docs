## Open API Documentation
All of Contrast's public API endpoints can be viewed [online](https://api.contrastsecurity.com). The documentation is built continuously and stays current with our latest SaaS release. The same documentation can also be found embedded in the TeamServer for both SaaS and EOP customers. Simply authenticate with an administrator account within TeamServer, select Settings, then select API. From there you will be able to launch the API documentation tool.

## Using the Documentation
Contrast's RESTful API documentation provides resources to understand how to use the endpoints to help you authenticate, navigate, collect data, and take actions on TeamServer programmatically. See the list under "API" and "Objects" for the endpoints and the related objects used by the endpoints. "Flow" provides a list of sample use cases and the information of their sequence of endpoints that need be called to accomplish them.

The documentation also includes a playground to test your endpoint interactions. This is a handy tool to quickly learn how to use the endpoints through experience.

The documentation is comprehensive, as it includes endpoints for v1, v2 and v3 API endpoints.
