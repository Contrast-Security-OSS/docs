As Contrast becomes an integral part of your development lifecycle, you might want to let users know when things like scheduled downtime will occur, or that an update has been applied. System messages allow you to immediately alert all users in your organizations every time they log in to Contrast, and continue to send the alert until your chosen expiration date. 

## Create a System Message

To create a new system message, navigate to your [SuperAdmin view](admin-systemsettings.html#system-glance), and go to the **user menu > System Settings > System Messages tab**.

Click the button to **Create a Message**. In the dialog that appears, set an expiration date and time for the message, and add the text in the **Message** field. This message will display until you either deleted or it reaches expiration.

> **Note:** Users must manually acknowledge system messages before they can continue with their tasks in the Contrast UI. 

## Delete a System Message

If you want to immediately deactivate an active system message, use the checkbox to select the message, and click the **Delete** button.
