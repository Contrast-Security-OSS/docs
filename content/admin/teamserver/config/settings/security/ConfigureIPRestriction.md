## Getting Started
As an Administrator you can limit the range of Internet addresses (IPs) that your organizational accounts can login from. This means that even if an attacker obtained valid credentials for one of your Contrast users, they wouldn't be able to login without originating their login request from your network. To create an IP restriction, go to the administrator settings menu option and select Security. 

The page helpfully tells you the current IP address that Contrast detects your traffic is from, and allows you to specify a list of IP addresses or IP ranges (one per line) to restrict traffic from.
