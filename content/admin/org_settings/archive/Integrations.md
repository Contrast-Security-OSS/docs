## Bugtrackers

Contrast can connect to bugtrackers in order to streamline the remediation process. Individual or groups of discovered vulnerabilities can be sent directly to a configured bugtracker so that development groups may implement a fix.

### Support

Contrast supports integrations with:

1. Mozilla Bugzilla
2. Atlassian JIRA
3. Serena Business Manager

### Exporting findings

Sending vulnerabilities to the bugtracker can be done from the **Send Vulnerability** (paper plane) icon located on the **Vulnerabilities** page, or from the **Vulnerabilities** tab of an **Application Overview** page. 

In the dialog that follows, choose which information should be included when exporting the findings.

<a href="assets/images/KB3-f04_1.png" rel="lightbox" title="Bugtracker Export Options"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB3-f04_1.png"/></a>

>**Note:** Bugtrackers must be configured before vulnerabilities can be sent.

<a href="assets/images/NoBugTracker.png" rel="lightbox" title="No Bugtrackers Available"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/NoBugTracker.png"/></a>

When a vulnerability is sent to a bugtracker, the status of the vulnerability changes to **Reported** in the **Vulnerabilities** page or the **Vulnerabilities** tab of the **Application Overview** page. An arrow icon also appears beside the status in the grid row for the vulnerability. Hovering over this icon produces a tooltip that includes the bugtracker name(s) and corresponding ticket number(s). 

<a href="assets/images/Integrations-sent-to-bugtracker.png" rel="lightbox" title="Vulnerabilities sent to bugtracker"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/Integrations-sent-to-bugtracker.png"/></a>

To quickly see which vulnerabilities are being tracked, select **Advanced** and **Status** in the sidebar. Hovering over the **Being Tracked** and **Untracked** options also produces a tooltip.

## JIRA Integration
Integrating JIRA with Contrast allows you to automatically generate tickets, synchronize comments and push notifications for your applications.

Once you complete the fields, click **Test connection**. This process may take a few moments depending on the number of your JIRA projects. The test verifies that the JIRA instance can be reached by Contrast and that the specified user is able to log in.

Once a connection is made, select the applications that you want to be available to this bugtracker as well as customize the values for the Project, Assignee and Default Issue Type fields. You can also customize the Default Severity levels and Additional JIRA fields. Note that we automatically include any required JIRA fields to ensure that you donâ€™t have any trouble.
