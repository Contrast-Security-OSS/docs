Contrast offers compliance reports for understanding an application's compliance status.

* **DISA ASD STIG:** DISA's Application Security and Development STIG reports the security posture as it relates to policy requirements for security programs and best practices for Information Assurance (IA)-enabled applications.
* **OWASP 2013 Top 10:** The Open Web Application Security Project reports the problems that are “worth fixing” or in the top ten list of flaws. 
* **PCI DSS - 2.0 & 3.0:** The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard protects cardholder data in the event of a data breach. To achieve compliance, organizations must identify and remediate all critical vulnerabilities.

Report settings offer a single interface for organization administrators to define the template of hard-copy reports. Select **Organization Settings** in the user menu and **Report Settings** in the left navigation. This essentially involves defining the default values for reports created within the organization such as:

* Report Type
* Vulnerability Status
* Vulnerability Tag
* Inclusions: Whether to include status of vulnerabilities or notes on the vulnerabilities in the report
* Custom Footer

When viewing the **Application Details** page, users can generate a PDF report to see how the application is doing as it relates to compliance requirements. The defaults will prepopulate the report generation dialog, but the user can still make any necessary changes.
