Two-step verification uses an auto-generated Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP) security token to add an extra layer of protection on top of your username and password. You can access two-step verification codes with your Contrast-associated email address, or by using the Google Authenticator mobile application that's available on the following devices:

* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)
* [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)
* [Blackberry](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/29401059/?lang=en&countrycode=US)

## Administrator Set Up

Two-step verification is controlled at three levels: System, Organization and User. 

The System Administrator can enable or disable the feature using a radio button by going to **System Settings > Security > Two-Step Verification**. If two-step verification is on, the Organization Administrator may choose whether or not to require the feature for users. If you'd like to allow an Organization Admin to override this choice, check the box to **Allow organization override**.

Organization Administrators can go to **Organization Settings > Security > Two-Step Verification section**, and use the radio button to require users to set up two-step verification. If users are required to set up the feature, a lock icon indicates that users can't make changes. If users aren't required to set up the feature, the user can toggle the feature on or off. 

Check the box for **Google Authenticator** or **Email** to set your notification method.

> **Note:** If a user belongs to multiple organizations, their default organization determines their two-step verification settings.

## User Onboarding

### Required setup 

If two-step verification is enabled and required, the user is onboarded the next time they login.

The user receives a message explaining that their administrator requires the feature. The user can click the link to **Learn More** about two-step verification, why it's needed and how it works. The user can also go directly to the setup process by clicking the button to **Get Started**. 

### Optional setup

If two-step verification is enabled but not required, the user is prompted to begin onboarding the next time that they login; however, they can choose to opt out of the process by clicking the **No Thanks** link. The user won't receive this prompt at future logins.
