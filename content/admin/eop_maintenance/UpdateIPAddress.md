Updating Contrast's IP address is fairly straightforward. Whether you moved the installation or had to change the hostname or IP address, you can let Contrast know in a few simple steps. 

* Log in to the UI as the SuperAdmin.
* Go to the **user menu > System Settings > General Settings tab**.
* In the **General** panel, change the **TeamServer URL** to *IP:port/Contrast*.
* Click **Save**.
* [Restart Contrast](installation-setupinstall.html#restart) to apply the changes.

>**Note:** You must also replace your agents so they know the new address to which they now report.
