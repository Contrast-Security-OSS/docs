System and Organization Administrators can create users individually, in groups, or through [Microsoft Active Directory](installation-setupauth.html#ad) (AD) or [LDAP](installation-setupauth.html#ldap) integrations. All users are required to have a default organization and a default role within that organization. 

>**Note:** Verify the [Roles](admin-manageorgsroleperm.html#roles) that you want to assign to users so that they have the appropriate level of functionality.

You may decide to designate an [Application Access Group](admin-onboardteam.html#group), which defines more administrative functionality or greater access restrictions for the users for specific applications.

## System Settings

As an Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) customer, you can delegate users to perform system administration functions across organizations - such as managing users, groups, applications, licenses, API keys and security policies - if you created multiple organizations in Contrast as part of a multi-tenant deployment. See [Granting and Revoking SuperAdmin Permissions](admin-manageorgs.html#sa) to get started.

To create users as a System Administrator, go to the **User menu** and choose **SuperAdmin** in the **Use Contrast Security as** section. Select the **Users** page in the top navigation. 

### Individual users

To add a single user, complete the following steps. 

* Click the button above the grid to **Add User**.
* Enter the user's **First Name**, **Last Name** and **Email Address** in the provided fields. 
* Check the box if you want to **Require email activation** instead of requiring a password.
* Choose which of the **System Roles** should apply to the user in the dropdown menu. The default is **None**. 
* Choose the **Organization** to which the user belongs. 
* Choose the default **Organization Role** in the dropdown menu as well as an **Application Access Group** in the multiselect field.
* Choose the **Date Format**, **Time Format** and **Time Zone** in the dropdown menus. 
* The box to **Use Organization Settings** is checked by default. Uncheck the box to **Use Organization Settings** to create your own settings using the **Access** toggle, or to enable the checkbox to **make user API only**. 
* Use the toggle to enable **Protect** access for the user. The toggle is **off** by default. 
* Click the **Add** button to save the information and create the user.

### Multiple users 

To bulk add users, click the upload icon above the grid in the **Users** page to import a spreadsheet with the users' information. The spreadsheet must be CSV format, and include the following fields for each user. **All field headings and values in the spreadsheet must be formatted as shown.** 

#### Required information 

The following fields must be included in the spreadsheet. See the **Templates** section to download spreadsheets in CSV format. 

* **First Name**

(If using the provided CSV template, you must replace the **Email** field heading with **Username**.) The username values entered in the spreadsheet and the authentication configuration must match exactly.
