Log Enhancers are instrumentation instructions that allow the Contrast agent to log additional parameters and data in the application without requiring any source code changes. By using these deep security instrumentation techniques, a user can specify the API and parameter to log, and the Contrast agent adds this information to the *security.log* file as part of RASP logging. 

## Manage Log Enhancers

Organization and Policy (Rules) Administrators can manage Log Enhancers by going to the **User menu > Policy Management > Log Enhancers tab**.
