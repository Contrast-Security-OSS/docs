Manage IPs in your organization with blacklists, whitelists (trusted hosts) and source names. Organization and Rules admins can go to the **user menu > Policy Management > IP Management tab** to create and manage your preferences.

* **IP Blacklists** allow you to put a rule in place to distrust an IP, considering it unacceptable. This appropriate for immediate triage until you can put a more permanent Protect policy in place or conduct an investigation.
* **Trusted Hosts** let you whitelist a host that is conducting an internal vulnerability scan to avoid polluting Contrast with non-attack data.
* [Source Names](admin-ipmgmt.html#source-name) allow you to mark one or more trusted IP addresses or subnet masks as any name you choose. The chosen name then appears in your **Attacks > Monitor** page as well as **Attack Events**, which allows you to quickly identify and differentiate them from attack data that needs your attention.
