Assess Rules allow you to detect specific types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection or Cross site scripting, in an application. These rules are language specific, and can be turned on or off for each environment and each application. 

## How It Works

Contrast provides out-of-the-box rules that can be applied to your applications. Organization or Rules Admins can configure Assess Rules, and also see the rules applied across your portfolio from the **Policy Management** page or an application's details page. Each rule is categorized with a Severity and Description to provide more information in the Asses Rules grid. 

## Manage Rules

### Policy Management 

View Assess Rules by going to the **User menu > Policy Management > Assess Rules tab**. In the Assess Rules grid, thermometer charts show the number of applications that have each rule applied for each environment. Hover over the charts to see a list of the application names for each number count.
