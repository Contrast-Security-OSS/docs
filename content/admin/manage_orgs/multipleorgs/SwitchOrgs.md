Once a user's account has access to multiple organizations through one or more [organization groups](admin-onboardteam.html#group), the user can move between organizations in the user Menu.

> **Note**: Only EOP customers deploying in a multi-tenant deployment with two or more organizations can move between organizations.

To toggle between organizations, log in to the Contrast UI and go to the **user menu**. Under the "Use Contrast Security as:" section of the menu, choose an organization from the names listed.

> **Note:** Each organization contains settings specific to that organization. If you're an Organization Administrator (OrgAdmin) for multiple organizations, you must use this process to switch to the organization for which you want to configure settings.
