Contrast Security’s <!-- Quick Value delivery --> deployment methodology is designed to reduce the time to achieve your desired business outcomes and to create an inspiring onboarding experience for your team. 

To expedite deployment, information gathered in the sales stage (e.g., your goals and desired timelines) is shared with Contrast's onboarding team, who then passes discovery from the onboarding stage to Customer Success representatives. Contrast also simplifies the initial process for your team by consolidating multiple activities into a handful of meetings. With each of step of the process, Contrast’s Customer Success representatives will continue to shepherd you through setup and onboarding Contrast's [Assess](assess-howitworks.html) and [Protect](protect-howitworks.html) products.

During the beginning stage of deployment, the Customer Success team will use the Contrast Security Maturity Model to help you position your organization to improve its processes. 

## Contrast Security Maturity Model

The Contrast Security Maturity Model is a flexible roadmap to help organizations accelerate secure software development and production deployment. It's designed to guide your thinking and the dialog Contrast will have with you about your strategic vision for application security, your current status and the appropriate target state for your initial Contrast deployment. Contrast's Customer Success representatives will help customize the model to create the journey that's ideal for you.

Once introduced to Contrast in phase 1, an organization can easily move to phase 2 by installing Assess agents in QA, engaging developers on the new approach and increasing visibility of application risk to provide initial value. Moving to phase 3 involves implementing consistent security policy in Contrast, which reduces cost to fix vulnerabilities and improves the CISO-level view of risk. 

The final phase provides organization-wide security policy enforced through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and using Protect to rebuff attacks. Phase 4 also provides the added benefits of reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) and accelerated time to market (TTM). By this time, Contrast is seamlessly integrated into the ecosystem of automated processes and tools.
