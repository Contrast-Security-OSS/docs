Organization administrators and Rules Admin users can manage policies that are applied to applications and servers for their organization. Go to the **Policy Management** page from the user menu. Policy is split into three categories in Contrast - General, Assessment, and Protection. Assessment Policy consists of Assess Rules and Security Controls, which we've highlighted in the left bar.
 
## Assess Rules
When Contrast Assess is turned on for an application, the vulnerabilities discovered are reported to Contrast based on rules defined. These rules are known as Assess rules, and include detection techniques for the vulnerabilities detected by Contrast, such as SQL injection, Cross Site scripting, etc. Each rule can be configured per server environment to give you more granular control should you need it. Read more about it in our articles on [Assess Rules](admin-policymgmt.html#assess).

## Security Controls
Security controls are methods in your code that make sure data is safe to use. Contrast offers these to set up corrective actions if unsafe data is received, or to "clean" the data passed in. Learn more by reading our article on [Security Controls](admin-policymgmt.html#security).
