## About Vulnerabilities 

When Contrast discovers code flaws while navigating your application, the Contrast application lets you know exactly where in the code the vulnerability was found and how the code was used. Vulnerabilities are presented and classified with a severity to help you manage and prioritize next steps. With this information, you must analyze these findings, track the findings, and remediate them so that your application is secure. 

## Analyze and Manage Findings

The **Vulnerabilities** page in the Contrast interface allows you to search, sort and sift through each application's vulnerabilities. As Contrast discovers these weaknesses, it provides guidelines for determining how to resolve them and prevent an attack. As you triage, you can mark a status and create tags as needed. For more details, keep reading about how to [Analyze Findings](user-vulns.html#analyze) and [Manage Vulnerabilities](user-vulns.html#manage-vuln).

## Track Vulnerabilities

You must keep track of the discovered vulnerabilities for planning and maintaining fixes to prevent attacks. Send vulnerabilities to bugtracker [integrations](admin-orgintegrations.html#integration-start), which your organization administrator can set up, or by email to notify users who don't have access to the Contrast interface. For more information, read the article to [Track Findings](user-vulns.html#track).

## Remediate Vulnerabilities

Contrast always provides an explanation of why the vulnerability was flagged and guidance on potential solutions and techniques to resolve the vulnerability. For more information, read our articles [How to Fix Vulnerabilites](user-vulns.html#remediate).
